Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, was repeatedly pressed on cuts to Medicaid in the House's budget bill at a town hall and pushed back on an attendee who said the cuts would lead to deaths.\n\"People are not \u2014 well, we all are going to die, so, for heaven\u2019s sakes,\" she said, prompting resounding jeers.\nThe exchange began with an attendee complaining to Ernst that the bill would give significant tax breaks to the ultrawealthy while kicking some people off Medicaid and food assistance programs. Ernst said the only people who face getting booted are those who should not be on Medicaid in the first place.\nShe later claimed that 1.4 million undocumented immigrants are receiving Medicaid benefits. That figure, which the White House and other top Republicans have also cited, is based on a Congressional Budget Office analysis that said that one provision of the bill would cause 1.4 million people to lose coverage (including but not limited to those without verified immigration status).\n\nFor more context and news coverage of the most important stories of our day click here: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/msnbc\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on TikTok https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@msnbc \n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/msnbc \nDownload our new MSNBC app for the latest breaking news and daily headlines at a glance: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/information\/download-msnbc-app-n1241692\n\nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/maddowblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of political headlines, commentary and informed perspectives.

The ruling blocks most of the tariffs Trump has rolled out so far in his second term, including the 10% rate applied to most trading partners and those on China. It also includes fentanyl-related levies on Canada and Mexico. For now, the judges\u2019 decision appears to have allayed investors\u2019 worries. However, this development can also raise concerns that U.S. trade negotiations with foreign countries could be drawn out into later in the year than previously anticipated.

The man in question was George Floyd and he was murdered by Officer Derek Chauvin. That initial police statement was false. And the truth only came out because of a 17-year-old with a cell phone camera. But, it should not be the work of a civilian to hold law enforcement to account.

Attorney General Pam Bondi recently escalated that rhetoric, calling these judges \u201cderanged\u201d\u2014a remark that former federal judge J.

While \u201cFun Home\u201d is ultimately an examination of Bechdel\u2019s family\u2019s dynamics, mental health, abuse, and sexual identity, Bechdel\u2019s relationship with her father is central. Beyond \u201cFun Home\u201d, her body of work is culturally foundational \u2013 it centered lesbians and the LGBTQ+ community in ways that simply had not been done before. Her weekly comic strip, which ran from 1983 to 2008, was nothing short of seminal and beloved. She also created the \u201cBechdel Test\u201d, which is a measure of representation of women in film, literature and other works.\n\nFor more context and news coverage of the most important stories of our day click here: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/msnbc\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on TikTok https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@msnbc \n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/msnbc \nDownload our new MSNBC app for the latest breaking news and daily headlines at a glance: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/information\/download-msnbc-app-n1241692\n\nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/maddowblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of political headlines, commentary and informed perspectives.

    "description":"Watch live coverage as President Donald Trump meets with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House on Wednesday in an effort to improve relations between the two countries after months of tensions.

Ramaphosa told reporters Tuesday that his visit Wednesday would focus on potential trade and investment deals, as well as aim to \u201cconsolidate good relations between our two countries.\u201d Trump has accused South Africa of being \"terrible\" to farmers, and in February he said the United States would cut off aid to the country, alleging on Truth Social that South Africa was \"treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY.\"\n\nFor more context and news coverage of the most important stories of our day click here: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/msnbc\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on TikTok https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@msnbc \n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/msnbc \nDownload our new MSNBC app for the latest breaking news and daily headlines at a glance: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/information\/download-msnbc-app-n1241692\n\nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/maddowblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of political headlines, commentary and informed perspectives.

    "description":"Tax policy has been a core part of the Republican party. A central feature within the GOP,  particularly since Reagan, has been cutting taxes for corporations and some of the wealthiest Americans. President Trump, breaking away from traditional party orthodoxy, recently raised the idea of increasing taxes on some of the country\u2019s richest. Our guest this week points out that Republicans have made a \u201cdevil\u2019s bargain\u201d with Trump. Arjun Singh is the co-host and senior producer of the Lever Time podcast. He is also the lead reporter and editor of the Tax Revolt miniseries. He joins \"Why Is This Happening?\" The Chris Hayes podcast to discuss historical and contemporary fights over taxes, coalitions effects of MAGA, what the latest intraparty disagreements could portend and more. \n\n\u201cWhy Is This Happening?\u201d The Chris Hayes podcast is produced by Doni Holloway and Brendan O\u2019Melia, engineered by Bob Mallory and features music by Eddie Cooper.

    "description":"A giant banner featuring Donald Trump\u2019s photo just went up at the front of the Department of Agriculture.

But now that it\u2019s starting to happen here, we have to acknowledge it and recognize it as a sign that America is sliding into autocracy.\n\nFor more context and news coverage of the most important stories of our day click here: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/msnbc\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on TikTok https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@msnbc \n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/msnbc \nDownload our new MSNBC app for the latest breaking news and daily headlines at a glance: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/information\/download-msnbc-app-n1241692\n\nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/maddowblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of political headlines, commentary and informed perspectives.

A decision siding with the administration would not only provide a boost to Trump's birthright citizenship proposal but would also help the administration implement other policies via executive actions, many of which have also been blocked nationwide by lower court judges.\n\nFor more context and news coverage of the most important stories of our day click here: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/msnbc\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on TikTok https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@msnbc \n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/msnbc \nDownload our new MSNBC app for the latest breaking news and daily headlines at a glance: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/information\/download-msnbc-app-n1241692\n\nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/maddowblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of political headlines, commentary and informed perspectives.

    "description":"MSNBC\u2019s Alex Wagner speaks with Sandor Lederer, director and founder of the Hungarian anti-corruption watchdog K-Monitor, about the scale of corruption in Hungary and how citizens have become desensitized to it. Ruling by scandal, he suggests, may be strategic: overwhelm the public until outrage fades, a tactic he also sees at play in the U.S. under President Trump. During the conversation, Lederer also draws disturbing parallels between Hungary\u2019s authoritarian drift and the current situation in the U.S., where Trump-era nepotism and elite power consolidation resemble Hungary\u2019s kleptocratic model. To Lederer, it\u2019s \u201ceven more scary\u201d to see these patterns take hold in a country once thought to have the world\u2019s stronger democratic safeguards.\n\nFor more context and news coverage of the most important stories of our day click here: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/msnbc\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on TikTok https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@msnbc \n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/msnbc \nDownload our new MSNBC app for the latest breaking news and daily headlines at a glance: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/information\/download-msnbc-app-n1241692\n\nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/maddowblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of political headlines, commentary and informed perspectives.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the agreement would be a \u201cfull and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.\u201d He added that \u201cmany other deals\u201d will follow, some of which are in \u201cserious stages of negotiation. He added that \u201cmany other deals\u201d will follow, some of which are in \u201cserious stages of negotiation.

Our guest this week is one of the authors of a study that found that just 3.5% of the population taking to the streets is enough to block authoritarian takeover. Erica Chenoweth is a political scientist at Harvard. They join to discuss historical and contemporary strategies for protesting, democratic backsliding, global comparisons and more. \n\n\u201cWhy Is This Happening?\u201d is produced by Doni Holloway and Brendan O\u2019Melia, engineered by Bob Mallory and features music by Eddie Cooper.

Political dissent led to the open rebellion that created the United States. And because of that, dissent is not only recognized in America\u2013it is cherished. But today, dissent is being punished and checks and balances are under attack. Judge J. Michael Luttig, former federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, says \u201cthere\u2019s no question in my mind\u201d that President Trump is \u201cof the school of constitutional denialism\u201d.\n\nFor more context and news coverage of the most important stories of our day click here: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/msnbc\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on TikTok https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@msnbc \n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/msnbc \nDownload our new MSNBC app for the latest breaking news and daily headlines at a glance: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/information\/download-msnbc-app-n1241692\n\nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/maddowblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of political headlines, commentary and informed perspectives.

In her new book, \u201cPersonhood: The New Civil War over Reproduction,\u201d she traces the roots of the fetal personhood movement back to the 1960s. If fetal personhood is recognized under law, it would grant constitutional rights to embryos\u2014bypassing voters, ballot initiatives, and even state constitutional protections. It remains to be seen if the Trump administration embraces the concept\u2013 which would eliminate democratic input on a deeply unpopular issue. Critics warn that Trump\u2019s symbolic gestures\u2014like an anti-trans order that used coded fetal personhood language\u2014are a troubling sign. \u201cThis is not a new fight\u2014this has been the fight. There is no daylight between the fetal personhood movement and the anti-abortion movement\u2014they are one and the same.\"\n\nFor more context and news coverage of the most important stories of our day click here: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/msnbc\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on TikTok https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@msnbc \n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/msnbc \nDownload our new MSNBC app for the latest breaking news and daily headlines at a glance: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/information\/download-msnbc-app-n1241692\n\nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/maddowblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of political headlines, commentary and informed perspectives.

Five remarkable years of inspiring writers, creating empathy, and giving readers that safe place to land. The other is grimmer. According to the American Library Association, \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d was the single most banned work of literature in America last year. It isn\u2019t an honor. It isn\u2019t a selling mechanism. It is a tragedy. \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d has become more than just a power story or a beautiful work of literature \u2013 it\u2019s become a symbol, representative of free speech, of access to literature, and of resistance. In five years, Johnson has become one of the most important voices in the fight against censorship. \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d has gone from a remarkable debut memoir to one of the most critical works of literature in the contemporary American canon. The sort of book that imparts a different lesson onto you every single time you reread it. \u201cThere are days that are heavier than others,\u201d says Johnson, \u201cbut it\u2019s the messages I get from so many people that have been saved by the texts.\u201d The attacks and band \u201ccould have stopped me from writing\u2026But it didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFor more context and news coverage of the most important stories of our day click here: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/msnbc\n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on TikTok https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@msnbc \n\u00bb Subscribe to MSNBC on Instagram https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/msnbc \nDownload our new MSNBC app for the latest breaking news and daily headlines at a glance: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/information\/download-msnbc-app-n1241692\n\nFollow MSNBC Show Blogs \nMaddowBlog: https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/maddowblog\n\nMSNBC delivers breaking news, in-depth analysis of political headlines, commentary and informed perspectives.
