A U.S. trade court blocked most of President Donald Trump's tariffs in a sweeping ruling on Wednesday that found the president overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from U.S. trading partners.\n\n2. The United States and Russia quarrelled in public on Wednesday over the intensifying Ukraine war after U.S. President Donald Trump warned that President Vladimir Putin was \"playing with fire\" and Moscow massed 50,000 troops near a Ukrainian region.\n\n3. A United Nations warehouse in war-torn Gaza was broken into by \"hordes of hungry people\" on Wednesday as aid trickles into the Palestinian enclave on the brink of famine and the United States readies new terms for a possible truce between Israel and Hamas.\n\n4. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, the U.S. astronauts left on the International Space Station last year by Boeing's troubled Starliner capsule, are on the up after returning to Earth in March, emerging from weeks of physical therapy to ramp up work with Boeing and various NASA programs.\n\n5. NATO will ask Germany to provide seven more brigades, or some 40,000 troops, for the alliance's defence, three sources told Reuters, under new targets for weapons and troop numbers that its members' defence ministers are set to agree on next week.\n\n#Trade #Tariffs #Court #Imports #Russia #Ukraine #War #Diplomacy #Gaza #Famine #Truce #Palestine #Astronauts #NASA #Space #Therapy #NATO #Germany #Defense #Troops #News #Reuters #Newsfeed\n\n\ud83d\udc49  Subscribe: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reuters\/?hl=en",

U.S. President Donald Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday with explosive false claims of white genocide and land seizures during a tense White House meeting that was reminiscent of his February ambush of Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\n3. Israel allowed 100 aid trucks carrying flour, baby food and medical equipment into the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the Israeli military said, as UN officials reported that distribution issues had meant that no aid had so far reached people in need.\n\n4. U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill cleared a crucial hurdle on Thursday, as the House of Representatives voted roughly along party lines to begin a debate that would lead to a vote on passage later in the morning.\n\n5. A serious accident occurred on Wednesday during the launch of a new North Korean warship while Kim Jong Un was attending the event, with the isolated state's leader calling it a \"criminal act\" that could not be tolerated, state media KCNA reported.\n\n#IsraeliEmbassy #Gunman #WashingtonDC #ProPalestine #Trump #Ramaphosa #WhiteHouse #Diplomacy #Aid #GazaStrip #Humanitarian #UN #TaxBill #HouseVote #Politics #NorthKorea #Warship #KimJongUn #Accident\n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed\n\n\ud83d\udc49  Subscribe: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reuters\/?hl=en",

    "description":"Family members and attorneys arrive in court for hip hop mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial.\n\nProsecutors say Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, forced women to take part in days-long, drug-fueled sexual performances known as \u2018Freak Offs\u2019 from 2004 to 2024. They say his employees helped by buying drugs, booking and stocking hotel rooms, and giving Combs cash to pay male sex workers to take part in the parties.\n\nCombs, 55, has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers have acknowledged that Combs had substance abuse issues and was an abusive romantic partner, but say the sex acts described by prosecutors were consensual.\n\n#diddy #seancombs #trial #court #sextrafficking #newyork #live #Reuters #News  \n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/",

Israeli air strikes killed at least 50 Palestinians in Gaza on Tuesday, local health authorities said, as Israel continues its bombardment despite mounting international pressure to stop military operations and allow aid into Gaza unimpeded.\n\n2. Donald Trump said after his call on Monday with President Vladimir Putin that Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations for a ceasefire, but the Kremlin said the process would take time and the U.S. president indicated he was not ready to join Europe with fresh sanctions to pressure Moscow.\n\n3. China cut benchmark lending rates for the first time since October on Tuesday, while major state banks lowered deposit rates as authorities work to ease monetary policy to help buffer the economy from the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war.\n\n4. The U.S. Supreme Court let Donald Trump's administration on Monday end temporary protected status that was granted to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the United States by his predecessor Joe Biden, as the Republican president moves to ramp up deportations as part of his hardline approach to immigration.\n\n5.  Malnutrition rates in Gaza have risen during a more than 11-week Israeli blockade and could rise exponentially if food shortages continue, a health official at the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said on Tuesday.\n\n#Gaza #AirStrikes #InternationalPressure #Aid\n#Trump #Russia #Ceasefire #Sanctions\n#China #LendingRates #MonetaryPolicy #TradeWar\n#SupremeCourt #Immigration #Deportations #Venezuelans\n#Malnutrition #Blockade #FoodShortages #UNRWA\n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed\n\n\ud83d\udc49  Subscribe: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reuters\/?hl=en",

Russian and Ukrainian negotiators were in Istanbul for what was billed as their first direct peace talks in more than three years, under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two.\n\n3. Chinese worker Liu Shengzun lost two jobs in just one month as U.S. import tariffs shot up to triple digits in April, forcing a Guangdong lighting products factory, and then a footwear maker, to reduce output.\n\n4. The U.S. Supreme Court wrestled over Donald Trump's attempt to broadly enforce his executive order to restrict birthright citizenship, a move that would affect thousands of babies born each year as the Republican president seeks a major shift in how the U.S. Constitution has long been understood.\n\n5. India is considering plans to dramatically increase the water it draws from a major river that feeds Pakistani farms downstream, as part of retaliatory action for a deadly April attack on tourists that New Delhi blames on Islamabad, according to four people familiar with the matter.\n\n#Trump #billion #Etihad #Boeing #GEengines #Russia #Ukraine #peace #Tariff #China #layoffs #market #US #SupremeCourt #birthrightcitizenship \n#India #Pakistan #water #News #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\n\ud83d\udc49  Subscribe: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reuters\/?hl=en",

U.S. President Donald Trump met with Syria's president in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and urged him to normalise ties with longtime foe Israel, after a surprise U.S. announcement that it would lift all sanctions on the Islamist-led government.\n\n2. Testing and monitoring of HIV patients across South Africa have fallen since the United States cut aid that funded health workers and clinics, with pregnant women, infants and youth the most affected, previously unpublished government data shows.\n\n3. The Russian economy is in an increasingly precarious state as a result of a shift to a war mode and of Western sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, a report by the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics (SITE) said.\n\n4. President Donald Trump's approval rating rose this week as Americans worried less about his handling of the economy and prospects of a recession, according to a Reuters\/Ipsos poll that closed.\n\n5. Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' former girlfriend Casandra Ventura, the star prosecution witness at his sex trafficking trial, testified on Tuesday that the rapper and hip-hop mogul forced her into repeated drug-fueled sex parties he organized.\n\n#Trump #Syria #SaudiArabia #Qatar #HIV #SouthAfrica #aid #Russia #economy #Moscow #EU #recession #SeanCombs #Diddy #News #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\n\ud83d\udc49  Subscribe: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reuters\/?hl=en",

U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia at the start of a four-day visit to the wealthy Gulf region, focusing more on economic deals than regional security matters ranging from war in Gaza to talks on Iran's nuclear program.\n\n2. The United States will cut the \"de minimis\" tariff for low-value items imported from China, a White House executive order said, further de-escalating a potentially damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\n3. U.S. President Donald Trump has offered to attend Thursday's proposed meeting between President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Russia's Vladimir Putin in Istanbul, which has become the focus of his attempts to end the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two. Putin has yet to say if he will take part.\n\n4. U.S. President Donald Trump signed a wide-reaching executive order directing drugmakers to lower the prices of their medicines to align with what other countries pay that analysts and legal experts said would be difficult to implement.\n\n5. An Israeli-American hostage was released from 19 months of captivity in Gaza during a brief pause in fighting and reunited with his family, but Israeli strikes on the battered enclave soon resumed. Israel's military received Edan Alexander, 21, from the International Committee of the Red Cross, which facilitated his transfer from Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\n#Trump #Gulf #economics #USA #deminimis #tariff #China #shipments #Russia #Ukraine #ukrainewar #peace #pharma #industry #Israel #American #hostage #Gaza #ceasefire #News #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\n\ud83d\udc49  Subscribe: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reuters\/?hl=en",

India and Pakistan accused each other of launching new military attacks on Friday, using drones and artillery for the third day in the worst fighting between the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours in nearly three decades.\n\n2. Former Cardinal Robert Prevost stunned his hometown on Thursday when the Vatican announced that the 69-year-old Chicago native had been chosen as the first U.S.-born pontiff in the 2,000-year history of the Catholic Church.\n\n3. U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday announced a limited bilateral trade agreement that leaves in place Trump's 10% tariffs on British exports, modestly expands agricultural access for both countries and lowers prohibitive U.S. duties on British car exports.\n\n4. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued internal instructions to the Pentagon to start kicking out transgender troops who do not elect to leave on their own by June 6, according to a memo obtained by Reuters.\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n5. Russia marked the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two on Friday with a major military parade that went off without any reports of Ukrainian attacks despite three years of devastating war.\n\n#Pakistan #India #Chicago #pope #popeleo #Trump #Starmer #trade #military #transgender #troops #Russia #China #Ukraine #war #News #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\n\ud83d\udc49  Subscribe: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reuters\/?hl=en",

    "description":"1. Pakistan said on Thursday it shot down 25 drones from India in its airspace while India said it \"neutralised\" Pakistan's attempts to strike military targets with drones and missiles, as fighting spread between the nuclear-armed neighbours.\n\n2. Police arrested dozens of Columbia University students who seized part of the school's main library on Wednesday in one of the biggest pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus since last year's wave of protests against Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n3. The United States and Britain will announce a deal to lower tariffs on some goods on Thursday, the first such agreement since U.S. President Donald Trump sparked a global trade war with universal levies.\n\n4. Black smoke has again billowed from a chimney on top of the Sistine Chapel. That signalled the cardinals locked in a conclave have not yet chosen a new pope to guide the Roman Catholic Church. The cardinals held an initial inconclusive vote on Wednesday evening and two more votes on Thursday morning as thousands of faithful again gathered in St. Peter's Square.\n\n5. Ukraine is starting to consider a shift away from the U.S. dollar, possibly linking its currency more closely to the euro amid the splintering of global trade and its growing ties to Europe, Central Bank Governor Andriy Pyshnyi told Reuters.\n\n#India #Pakistan #military #conflict #nucleararmed #students #arrest #protest #ColumbiaUniversity #USA #Britain #tariff #smoke #conclave #vote #pope #Ukraine #dollar #euro #News #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\n\ud83d\udc49  Subscribe: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reuters\/?hl=en",
