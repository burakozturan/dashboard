    "title":"What Happened to Pride at the Kennedy Center? Trump\u2019s Appointees Did",
    "description":"For weeks, LGBTQ+ events related to WorldPride and Pride Month started disappearing from the Kennedy Center\u2019s calendar. And now, the Capital Pride Alliance has confirmed that the Tapestry of Pride programming planned for this June has either been moved or canceled. This comes after Trump appointed himself as the center\u2019s chairman and replaced the board of trustees with Trump loyalists committed to his \u2018anti-DEI\u2019 agenda.\n\nThe Tapestry of Pride programming \u2014 including events like a family-friendly drag story time and a display of portions of the AIDS Memorial Quilt \u2014 will now be held at the WorldPride Welcome Center in D.C. Other events, like a performance from the Gay Men\u2019s Chorus of Washington D.C., were also canceled.\n\nThe event, originally scheduled to start on May 17 and run through June 8, was expected to bring in millions of dollars in tourism revenue and visitors to our nation\u2019s capital. Businesses have withdrawn their support from the event, including Eagle Canada, the country\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ rights organization, and performers like Issa Rae have canceled their planned performances at the Kennedy Center in response.",

    "title":"Trump Admin Moves to Cut Lifeline for LGBTQ+ Youth in Crisis",
    "description":"LGBTQ+ youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide. The Trump administration, under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, is slashing funding for a life-saving resource.\n\nA leaked Health and Human Services budget revealed plans to eliminate services specifically for LGBTQ+ youth who call the national suicide hotline. Counselors trained with cultural competency to help those in crisis would no longer be available.\n\n\u2018Here we are cutting off the nation\u2019s lifeline to those in crisis,\u2019 Paolo del Vecchio, former director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration\u2019s Office of Recovery, told Mother Jones. \u2018Due to the discriminatory practices of the Trump administration, they\u2019re pulling that life preserver away from thousands and thousands of people.\u2019\n\nThe leaked budget also revealed further cuts, including the elimination of the Head Start preschool program and reductions to the Centers for Disease Control.",
