    "description":"Legal residents of the United States sent to foreign prisons without due process. Students detained after voicing their opinions. Federal judges threatened with impeachment for ruling against the administration\u2019s priorities.\n\nIn this Opinion video, Marci Shore, Timothy Snyder and Jason Stanley, all professors at Yale and experts in authoritarianism, explain why America is especially vulnerable to a democratic backsliding \u2014 and why they are leaving the United States to take up positions at the University of Toronto.\n\nProfessor Stanley is leaving the United States as an act of protest against the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on civil liberties. \u201cI want Americans to realize that this is a democratic emergency,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessor Shore, who has spent two decades writing about the history of authoritarianism in Central and Eastern Europe, is leaving because of what she sees as the sharp regression of American democracy. \u201cWe\u2019re like people on the Titanic saying our ship can\u2019t sink,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what you know as a historian is that there is no such thing as a ship that can\u2019t sink.\u201d\n\nShe borrows from political and apolitical Slavic motifs and expressions, arguing that the English language does not fully capture the democratic regression in this American moment.\n\nProfessor Snyder\u2019s reasons are more complicated. Primarily, he\u2019s leaving to support his wife, Professor Shore, and their children, and to teach at a large public university in Toronto, a place he says can host conversations about freedom. At the same time, he shares the concerns expressed by his colleagues and worries that those kinds of conversations will become ever harder to have in the United States.\n\n\u201cI did not leave Yale because of Donald Trump or because of Columbia or because of threats to Yale \u2014 but that would be a reasonable thing to do, and that is a decision that people will make,\u201d he wrote in a Yale Daily News article explaining his decision to leave.\n\nTheir motives differ but their analysis is the same: ignoring or downplaying attacks on the rule of law, the courts and universities spells trouble for our democracy.\n\nMore from The New York Times Video: \nOpinion Video: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/spotlight\/opinion-video\nSubscribe: http:\/\/bit.ly\/U8Ys7n\nWatch all of our videos here: http:\/\/nytimes.com\/video\u200b\u200b\n----------\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.

Since two of my closest friends also chose a child-free life, I came up with a small experiment: We swapped moms. Each of us sat down for an open conversation not with our own mother but with another\u2019s.\n\nIn a world where the right of women to make decisions about their bodies and life choices is still questioned, where child-free women are often seen as broken or selfish, I made this film to put that experience onscreen. Filmed in Israel in 2023, it captures a deeply personal and ongoing conversation.

That question has plagued the filmmaker Shaina Feinberg.\n\nBefore Ms. Feinberg was born, her mother dreamed of a successful career as a performer \u2014 then gave up those dreams to raise her daughters. That loss still haunts her mother.\n\nNow a mother herself, Ms. Feinberg is confronted with the same dilemma: Should she quit working as a filmmaker to be a full-time mom? Or keep doing a \u201cdepressingly bad job at both\u201d?\n\nThe universe answers her in the unlikely form of Joan Darling, a 90-year-old director and actress. She\u2019s the first woman to be nominated for an Emmy in directing. And unlike Ms. Feinberg\u2019s mother, she never had children.\n\nDuring the pandemic, a freelance job fortuitously connected Ms. Feinberg with Ms. Darling. That chance encounter spurred the pair to meet in person.\n\nFrom there, Ms. Darling becomes Ms. Feinberg\u2019s unexpected life coach on work and motherhood. They spend days filming \u2014 and playing \u2014 together, as Ms. Feinberg embarks on a journey to learn how to be a career woman and a mom at the same time.\n\nMore from The New York Times Video: \nOpinion Video: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/spotlight\/opinion-video\nSubscribe: http:\/\/bit.ly\/U8Ys7n\nWatch all of our videos here: http:\/\/nytimes.com\/video\u200b\u200b\n----------\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.

It\u2019s an experience filled with long waits, intimidating security measures and tight restrictions on the visit\u2019s duration.\n\nHaving had a family member incarcerated for over a decade, I\u2019ve seen the toll that prolonged separation has on women and their children. I\u2019ve made many long drives to prisons and witnessed the limitations that traditional visitation offers. I know that even as visiting means maintaining an emotional bond, it can make you feel isolated and emotionally confused.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the program featured in our film above so rare. Here, a reunification house in Goochland County allows women and their children to experience a full day together in a warmer environment than traditional visitation. Beginning in late 2022, the house has allowed a rotating cohort of women to spend time with their children over multiple visitations.\n\nIn this somewhat surreal setting, our short film \u201cWeekend Visits\u201d aims to witness the emotional spectrum of excitement, tension, confusion and love between two people who care about each other deeply but who are learning what it means to be parent and child again.\n\nMore from The New York Times Video: \nOp-Docs: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/column\/op-docs\nSubscribe: http:\/\/bit.ly\/U8Ys7n\nWatch all of our videos here: http:\/\/nytimes.com\/video\u200b\u200b\n----------\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.

    "description":"Viewers might not expect to see a DJ at a turntable in Ryan Coogler\u2019s 1930s-set horror movie \u201cSinners,\u201d but in this sequence, the history and future of music collide.\n\nThis sequence takes place in a juke joint opened by the twins Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan). Playing for the crowd is Sammie Moore (Miles Caton), performing a song that was written by Raphael Saadiq and the film\u2019s composer, Ludwig Goransson.\n\n\u201cRaphael is from Oakland, kind of a local legend where I\u2019m from,\u201d Coogler said, narrating the moment.\n\nThe scene starts with Caton\u2019s impressive vocals, while cutting to shots of both Smoke and Stack, as well as other characters in the sequence. \u201cWe wanted to use Michael Shawver\u2019s editing skills to establish where everybody is and what their stakes are,\u201d Coogler said.\n\nOnce all is laid out, the scene flashes back to a conversation between Sammie and another musician, Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo), who explains Sammie\u2019s skill for the blues and the responsibility that comes with his talent.\n\n\u201cBlues, it wasn\u2019t forced on us like that religion,\u201d Delta says. \u201cNo, son. We brought this with us from home. It\u2019s magic, what we do. It\u2019s sacred and big.\u201d\n\nAs the scene returns to the juke joint, we hear a voice-over from Annie (Wunmi Mosaku), a conjure woman. She says that some musicians have the gift to make music so powerful, it can conjure spirits from the past and the future. At this point, in an ambitious tracking shot, various eras of musicians appear in the frame, including an electric guitarist and the D.J. at the turntable.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to do it in a fluid, continuous take,\u201d Coogler said. New music elements continue to be introduced along with new forms of dance.\n\n\u201cAakomon Jones, our choreographer, is changing choreography ever so slightly so that folks still feel like they\u2019re in their time, but also outside of it as we get more and more heightened in this moment,\u201d Coogler said.\n\nRead the \u201cSinners\u201d review: https:\/\/bit.ly\/4iH05nL\nSubscribe: http:\/\/bit.ly\/U8Ys7n\nMore from The New York Times Video: http:\/\/nytimes.com\/video\n----------\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.
