Mr Adams described the claim as \u201ca grievous smear\u201d. \n\nThe BBC had argued that the words were couched as allegations but Adams argued they were presented as fact.\n\nSpeaking outside court, Adams says the case could have been resolved a long time ago, adding he was \u201cvery mindful of the Donaldson family\u201d throughout the trial.\n\nThe BBC said it was disappointed with the jury\u2019s decision with its Northern Ireland director saying: \u201cit was important that we defend our journalism and we stand by that decision\u201d. \n\nGerry Adams was the president of Irish republican party Sinn F\u00e9in from 1983 until 2018.

    "description":"Thousands of desperate Palestinians have overrun an aid distribution site in Gaza, which was  set up by a controversial US and Israeli-backed group a day earlier.\n\nFences were torn down at the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's (GHF) compound in the southern city of Rafah. The group said that at one point its team fell back because the numbers seeking aid were so great. The Israeli military said troops nearby fired warning shots.\n\nThe GHF employs armed American security contractors and intends to bypass the United Nations as the main supplier of aid in Gaza.  Experts there have warned of a looming famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade that has been partially-eased in recent days.  \n\nThe UN, which has decades of experience in providing aid in Gaza, said the videos from Rafah were \"heartbreaking\u201d.  It says it has a detailed plan to deliver enough aid to the \"desperate population\" of 2.1 million, if Israel permits it. \n\nThe UN and many aid groups have refused to co-operate with GHF's plans, which they say contradict humanitarian principles and appear to \"weaponise aid\". They have warned that the system will practically exclude those with mobility issues, force further displacement, expose thousands of people to harm, make aid conditional on political and military aims, and set an unacceptable precedent for aid delivery around the world.\n\nIsrael has said an alternative to the current aid system is needed to stop Hamas stealing aid, which the militant group denies doing.\n\nBen Brown presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson.\n\nSubscribe here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com\/news \n\n#BBCNews",

All these things are excuses for teams that don't win the league, and it's nice that if you have all these excuses, that you don't have to use them, but you still just won it.\"\n\nLiverpool secured the title without any serious strengthening of the squad Slot inherited, which he said made it \"probably even more special\".  And he drew comparisons with his time at Feyenoord, where he won the Eredivisie in 2023 despite an overhaul of his team.  \"I did it now in two different leagues and in two different ways.\u201d\n\nRecently the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lamented how \u201cred cards and injuries\u201d had impacted on his team\u2019s title bid.

    "title":"Sir Keir Starmer hails \u201cnew era\u201d as EU and UK agree trade deal | BBC News",
    "description":"The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called the new UK-EU deal a \u201cwin-win\u201d for both sides, after hosting the first joint summit between Britain and the European Union since Brexit. The UK and the EU have reached a new deal setting out post-Brexit relations on areas including fishing rights, trade and defence.\n\nThe deal will keep the current status quo giving EU boats continued access to UK waters until 2038. \nThe 2020 Brexit agreement, which saw the UK regain 25% EU fishing quotas, was due to run out next year. The UK will continue to agree yearly quotas with the EU and Norway and issue licences to control who fishes in its waters. A \u00a3360m \"fishing and coastal growth fund\" to invest in new technology and equipment.\n\nIn return for extending current fishing rules, the UK has secured a deal to reduce checks on food exports to the EUThe vast majority of routine border checks on animal and plant shipments to and from the EU will be dropped. The new sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) agreement means the UK can sell raw burgers and sausages back into the EU for the first time since Brexit.  Under the deal the UK will be expected to follow EU rules it does not write \u2013 overseen by the European Court of Justice. But it can break away if it keeps similar standards and avoids harming EU trade.\n\nA formal UK-EU defence and security pact has been established.  UK and EU officials will meet every six months to talk about defence and foreign policy. Both sides will coordinate on sanctions, share more information and develop a space-related security policy. The UK will join the EU's PESCO project on military mobility, aimed at speeding troop and equipment movement inside and outside the bloc.  The government says the agreement \"paves the way\" for UK-based arms firms to access the Security Action for Europe (Safe) - a \u00a3150bn EU fund providing loans for defence projects.\n\nThe UK and the EU have agreed to co-operate further on a \"youth experience scheme\" - but this will be subject to further negotiations. The government says such a scheme \"could see young people able to work and travel freely in Europe again\" but would be \"capped and time-limited\u201d.  It says the idea would mirror existing schemes the UK has with countries like Australia and New Zealand, where there is an annual quota of visas allowing people between the ages of 18 and 35 to work in each other's countries for up to three years. The UK is also negotiating to rejoin the Erasmus+ programme, which allows students to study or do an internship abroad.\n\nBritish holidaymakers will be able to use e-gates at more European airports. When Brexit ended free movement, UK travellers were shut out from using EU e-gates. Now the EU Commission says the there is no legal barrier to stopping UK citizens using them after the roll-out of its long-awaited digital border checks system, which is due to come into effect in October. Each EU country still decides if UK citizens can use e-gates at its ports but the government has promised to work to expand access \"as soon as possible\u201d.  A new passport system will make it easier for UK pets to travel, ending the need for repeat vet certificates.\n\nThe UK and EU will link their carbon markets to avoid taxes on carbon-intensive goods like steel and cement travelling between the UK and EU. The government says it will save \u00a3800m in taxes and shield British steel from EU tariffs, thanks to a UK-only deal worth \u00a325m a year. The UK will begin discussions on buying and selling directly into the EU's shared electricity market but the UK would have to follow EU rules to seal a deal.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Chris Mason, Faisal Islam, James Cook and Danny Savage.\n\nSubscribe here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com\/news \n\n#BBCNews",

Israel  has prevented any food or aid entering Gaza for more than two months.  The UN says around half a million people in Gaza are at \"critical risk of famine\".  \n\n\"For those killed and those whose voices are silenced: what more evidence do you need now?\", Mr Fletcher asked the Security Council.  \"Will you act, decisively, to prevent genocide and to ensure respect for international humanitarian law?\"  Mr Fletcher said UN agencies had \"life-saving supplies\" ready to deliver at the borders but were denied access by Israel. \n\nHe decribed a new Israel plan to deliver some aid as \"a cynical sideshow.\"  \"It makes starvation a bargaining chip,\" Fletcher said. \"A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement. If any of this still matters, have no part in it.\"\n\nIn a joint statement, five European members of the UN Security Council said that they were \"deeply concerned\" at the Israeli plan \"which the UN has said would not meet humanitarian principles.\"\n\nThe statement, by France, Britain, Slovenia, Greece and Denmark said:  \u201chumanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool or a military tactic.\u201d\n\nIsrael launched its assault on Gaza after Hamas killed almost 1,200 people in its attacks of October 7th 2023 in which it took hundreds of people hostage.\n \nIsrael's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, rejected the UN allegations against his government as \"baseless and outrageous accusations.\"\n\nSophie Raworth presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Fergal Keane and Jeremy Bowen.\n\nSubscribe here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com\/news \n\n#BBCNews",

    "description":"Robert Prevost, 69, will be the 267th occupant of the throne of St Peter and he will be known as Leo XIV.\n \nHe is the first American to fill the role of Pope, although he is considered as much a cardinal from Latin America because of the many years he spent as a missionary in Peru, before becoming a bishop there.\n \nBorn in Chicago in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Prevost served as an altar boy and was ordained as a priest in 1982. Although he moved to Peru three years later, he returned regularly to the US to serve as a pastor and a prior in his home city.\n \nSubscribe here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com\/news\n \n#Conclave #Pope #BBCNews",

On discovering the abuse, her father called the police.\n \nA court hearing for a criminal complaint against the priest, Peter Kanchong, accused of assault and battery of a minor, was set for 24 August 1984.\n \nBut unbeknownst to the family, something extraordinary was taking place behind the scenes. The Church \u2013 an institution that wielded enormous power in a deeply Catholic city \u2013 believed that the court was on its side.\n \nSubscribe here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1rbfUog For more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com\/news \n \n#CatholicChurch #US #BBCNews",

    "description":"The Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists to \"intensify and expand\" its operations in Gaza.\n \nThe Israel Defense Forces said it was \"increasing the pressure\" with the aim of returning hostages held in Gaza and defeating Hamas militants.\n \nCritics say the recent military offensive, after a ceasefire broke down, has failed to guarantee the release of captives, and question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's objectives in the conflict.\n \nIsraeli media report that the Israeli security cabinet has approved the renewed military expansion in Gaza. But reports suggest it will not happen until after President Donald Trump's trip to the region next week.\n \nSubscribe here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com\/news\n \n#Israel #Gaza #BBCNews",

    "title":"Frontline report: Syrian govt forces monitored armed civilians during sectarian violence | BBC News",
    "description":"Armed gunmen in Syria who carried out a wave of recent sectarian killings of the country\u2019s Alawite minority were monitored by government forces, according to evidence gathered by the BBC. \n\nOne man, Abu Khalid,  said he had travelled as a civilian fighter to the Mediterranean coastal village of Sanobar on 7 March, to help battle former regime insurgents. \n\nHe filmed himself shooting dead a 64-year-old village resident, Mahmoud Yusef Mohammed, at the entrance to his house. Abu Khalid, who has now been arrested, insisted his victim was an armed insurgent.  However video he filmed of the incident does not support his account.   He now says he had been told by the government security officials not to harm civilians but only to shoot at insurgents.\n\nHuman rights groups estimate that almost 900 civilians, mainly Alawites, were killed by pro-government forces across Syria's coastal region in early March.  The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam and its followers make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni.  Syria\u2019s former President Bashar al-Assad who fled the country last December is an Alawite.\n\nSyria's coastal area - a stronghold of the former regime - has been largely sealed off, but a BBC team gained access, speaking to witnesses and security officials about what happened in Sanobar.  The violence came a day after fighters loyal to the country's former President led deadly raids on government security forces. \n\nSyria\u2019s new Sunni Islamist-led government had called for support from various military units and militia groups to respond to those raids \u2013 but that escalated into a wave of sectarian anger against Alawite civilians.  \n\nWitnesses told the BBC that several armed groups had targeted Alawites and carried out summary executions. Some also said that government security forces had battled violent and extremist factions in order to protect Alawite villagers from attack.\n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson in Sanobar.\n\nSubscribe here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com\/news \n\n#BBCNews",

    "description":"Prince Harry  has told the BBC he \"would love a reconciliation\" with the Royal Family, in an emotional interview in which the Duke of Sussex said he was \"devastated\" at losing a legal challenge over his security in the UK.\n\nPrince Harry said King Charles \"won't speak to me because of this security stuff\", but that he did not want to fight anymore and did \"not know how much longer my father has\".\n\nThe Prince was speaking after losing an appeal over the levels of security he and his family are entitled to while in the UK.\n\nBuckingham Palace said: \"All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\"\n\nAfter Friday's court ruling, the prince said: \"I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point\u2026. There have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family,\" he added, but had now \"forgiven\" them.\n\n\"I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious,\" said Prince Harry, who said the dispute over his security had \"always been the sticking point\".\n\nThe prince had wanted to overturn changes to his security that were introduced in 2020 as he stepped down as a working royal and moved to the United States. Saying that he felt \"let down\", he described his court defeat as a \"good old fashioned establishment stitch up\" and blamed the Royal Household for influencing the decision to reduce his security.\n\nAsked whether he had asked the King to intervene in the dispute over security, Prince Harry said: \"I never asked him to intervene - I asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their jobs.\"\n\nThe prince said his treatment during the process of deciding his security had \"uncovered my worst fears\".  He said of the decision: \"I'm devastated - not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay. Is it a win for them?\"\n\nHe continued: \"I'm sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win.\"\n\nPrince Harry said the decision to remove his automatic security entitlement impacts him \"every single day\", and has left him in a position where he can only safely return to the UK if invited by the Royal Family - as he would get sufficient security in those circumstances.\n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Nada Tawfik and Sarah Campbell.\n\nSubscribe here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com\/news \n\n#BBCNews",
