Venomous snake bites aren\u2019t often at the top of the global health agenda, but each year, millions of people get bitten \u2014 often far away from antivenom treatment. To raise awareness, a new initiative called \"Strike Out Snakebite\" scattered human-sized snake statues throughout Geneva. Going forward, David Lalloo, the vice chancellor of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, says the initiative aims to boost funding for antivenom research and help bolster health systems so they can get bitten people to treatment before it\u2019s too late.

But it's worth noting the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people.\" The U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites involved seven B-2 Stealth Bombers and also included at least one submarine, according to Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon press conference.Caine said the mission, dubbed \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" represented the largest B-2 strike in U.S. history, involving more than 125 aircraft \u2014 including decoy flights \u2014 and saw 75 precision guided weapons dropped on the sites.  \"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" Caine said.Very few people knew details of the mission, Caine said, which began midnight Friday with B-2 bombers leaving from Kansas City, Mo.  Some of the bombers flew west into the Pacific as a decoy, while the main set of bombers flew 18 hours into Iran to carry out the attack.\"Once over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex, tightly timed maneuver requiring exact synchronization across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace, all done with minimal communications,\" Caine said. Around 5 p.m. Eastern time Saturday, a submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk missiles at a nuclear site in Isfahan as the bombers entered Iranian airspace. From approximately 6:40 p.m. to 7:05 p.m. Eastern time, the B-2s dropped 14 bunker-buster bombs on multiple targets at the Fordo and Natanz nuclear sites. The planes did not come under fire before, during or after the attack, Caine said.",

        "video_description": "The number of people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been rapidly growing. More than 55,000 people are now held in ICE custody, according to data from the administration, numbers that now surpassed the administration's previous high of those detained, which was reached during Trump's first term in 2019. Historical data collected by The Marshall Project suggest that the number \u2014 met just this month \u2014 is the highest ever recorded. What\u2019s more, it is nearly 15,000 more people than what ICE is currently funded for. Immigration experts say a big driver of the growth in how many people are detained comes from a shift in priorities: The Trump administration is arresting more people who haven\u2019t committed any crimes beyond their civil immigration violation. Nearly three out of four people currently in ICE custody have no criminal record \u2014 and that includes minor offenses like traffic violations.",
