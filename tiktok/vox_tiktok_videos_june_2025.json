Is calling it probiotic just a ploy to get you to pay more for yogurt? Ellen didn\u2019t leave a way to get in contact with her, but it\u2019s a good question! So we thought we\u2019d get to the bottom of it, on behalf of all Ellens who may have ever wondered this same thing. In this video, we break down what probiotics actually are, whether they do what they claim, and how yogurt fits into the picture. Are all yogurts probiotic? Are probiotics even worth it? Or is it all just a marketing scam?",
