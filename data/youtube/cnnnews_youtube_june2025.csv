The situation was already confusing, with stops and starts of tariffs at different levels. Then on Wednesday, a US court said Trump overstepped his authority in imposing most of those import levies – only for an appeals court on Thursday to pause the previous court’s ruling. The confusion has made it challenging for some small companies to plan, business owners told CNN.  “My fear is, if this continues, there’s going to be like the mass extinction of small businesses,” Julie Robbins, CEO of Ohio-based guitar pedal maker EarthQuaker Devices, told CNN's Phil Mattingly. Mattingly also spoke to grocery CEO Stew Leonard about tariffs on international produce. #CNN #News",2025-06-01T18:27:40Z,PT8M26S,506,0:08:26,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paSMOSgxauo

When hostile portions of the crowd balked at the response, she said: “For heaven’s sakes, folks.” The senator and her office argued Friday that Republicans are in fact trying to “strengthen” Medicaid. Ernst on Saturday issued a sarcastic apology in which she invoked the Tooth Fairy and encouraged people to convert to Christianity so they could have eternal life.
