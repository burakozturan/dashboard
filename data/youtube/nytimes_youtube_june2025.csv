0,The New York Times,uXGSgp5Mam0,Biden Joins Mourners of Assassinated Lawmaker and Her Husband,"Former President Biden joined thousands of mourners who streamed through the Minnesota State Capitol on Friday to pay their respects to State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. The couple were killed at their home this month in suburban Minneapolis, in what officials have described as a broader plan to assassinate Democratic officials.

Biden knelt briefly and crossed himself in front of the caskets, which flanked an urn containing the remains of the family’s beloved dog, Gilbert, who was also killed in the attack.

1,The New York Times,-6Pqs-heGkg,What Motherhood Cost Us | NYT Opinion,"Research has shown that 15 years after graduating college, mothers earn 11 percent less than women without children — and a staggering 42 percent less than fathers. There’s a term for this: the “motherhood penalty.” Last year, Times Opinion asked readers to tell us about their path to becoming mothers. Nearly 2,000 women of varying ages and from all corners of the country wrote in, but they weren’t all interested in describing their journey to parenthood. Instead, many shared how having children had put them in a punishing financial bind.

This week, Opinion published a video featuring interviews we conducted over the past several months with some of these women.

Reading through reader submissions, I was most struck by the stories of women who were confronting retirement with paltry financial reserves after leaving ambitious careers. They had found more flexible part-time work or in some cases dropped out of the labor market entirely to stay home with their kids, facing insurmountable child care costs or the demands of caring for children with special needs.

Listening to these women, you can tell they don’t regret having children — despite the sacrifices they’ve had to make. “Was it worth it? 100 percent,” one woman in the video said. It just shouldn’t come at such a high cost.

3,The New York Times,_IGypF0MUeM,Watch Hiccup and Toothless Connect in ‘How to Train Your Dragon’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"In the live-action version of “How to Train Your Dragon,” expressions can speak louder than words.

That’s the case in this early scene from the film, in which Hiccup (Mason Thames) has caught a Night Fury dragon and is conflicted about what to do. He comes from a line of Vikings who kill dragons as part of their warrior tribe, but when Hiccup gets close to the Night Fury, he connects with the dragon (whom he later nicknames Toothless) and can’t muster the will to kill the creature.

Narrating the scene, the director Dean DeBlois (who also directed the 2010 animated film), said, “This is one of the scenes that follows quite closely the animated movie. It’s a handful of scenes that I wanted to recreate almost shot for shot. But in this case we realized we didn’t need a lot of the dialogue that we gave Hiccup in the animated version. So much of it could be played on Mason Thames’s face.”

DeBlois said he spoke with his actor about the emotional way to play the scene.

“I remember on the day talking to Mason before we started rolling cameras, and I said, ‘Don’t forget, this is the moment you reference later in the movie when you looked into his eyes and you saw yourself.’ It seems like a moment of weakness but this is that strength in disguise that causes Hiccup to be a new thinker that can usher in an era of peace that nobody saw coming.”

Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist from Queens, tapped into a current of anxiety around New York City’s growing affordability crisis. His campaign brought new voters into the fold who rejected the scandal-scarred Cuomo’s ominous characterizations of the city and embraced an economic platform that included free bus service and child care and publicly owned grocery stores. #NewYork #mayor

17,The New York Times,Sf3wEg9tsCY,Did the Camera Ever Tell the Truth? | Death of a Fantastic Machine | Op-Docs,"Film and text by Maximilien Van Aertryck and Axel Danielson:
The camera is a tool — but to do what? Images shape our daily life, yet we rarely question how they’re made or why.

As filmmakers, we’re fascinated by how humans use cameras and by the immense influence images have. For 15 years, we’ve investigated the history of the camera, and we’ve turned the material we gathered into a feature documentary, chronicling how people behind the camera went from capturing the image of a backyard to today’s multibillion-dollar content industry.

The video above, “Death of a Fantastic Machine,” is a shorter version of that documentary, and here we focus on something that emerged as the key factor: how economic forces have shaped what we see, from the earliest photography to the algorithms and A.I. of today.

Some say there are an estimated 45 billion cameras on earth today, giving humankind access to perspectives far beyond our own reach. But the very tool that could help us understand the world is increasingly used to distort it. With A.I., this distortion has reached a new level. When any photo or video can be manufactured, what happens to the camera’s credibility? Can we still trust what we see?

20,The New York Times,Vji_pZrGut0,How the World Ends in ‘The Life of Chuck’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"A whimper? A bang? In this scene from “The Life of Chuck,” the world ends with a TV glow.

At the center of the sequence is Marty (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who is walking through a dark neighborhood as all is falling apart. His phone has died and he is headed to see his ex-wife when he encounters a young woman (Violet McGraw) on roller skates and strikes up a conversation. Their moment is interrupted by the cool glow of screens, all mysteriously projecting images of a man named Chuck (Tom Hiddleston).

In his narration, Flanagan said, “What I found really striking about this scene when Stephen King wrote it is that it’s a very kind of casual conversation of two people who just happen across each other during this apocalyptic time.”
The sequence is shot in a neighborhood near Mobile, Ala., where, Flanagan said, “we took over the power grid and basically blacked out the entire world there.”

For the glowing screens, rather than using expensive visual effects, Flanagan said, “we accomplished this the very old-fashioned way by hanging televisions in the windows on their sides and prerecording these videos and running around hitting play on each of them in order to get the image to appear.”

45,The New York Times,vF-bcTejHyI,Watch Dakota Johnson and Pedro Pascal Spark in ‘Materialists’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"A meet-cute, an intriguing drink order and a stealth character in the background make for a clever scene in Celine Song’s latest film, “Materialists.” Narrating this sequence, the writer-director said she chose this particular scene to discuss for this series “because it’s the first scene that I wrote.”

In it, Harry, played by Pedro Pascal, is at the reception following his brother’s wedding. He rearranges his name card so he can sit next to Lucy (Dakota Johnson), a matchmaker he quickly starts to hit on.

Discussing the scene, Song said she wanted the camera to settle on a long two-shot, in which Lucy and Harry have a thoughtful conversation.

“This really reflects how incredible my actors are,” she said, “because we’re really treating them like they’re theater actors having to have a whole conversation while sitting in this two-shot.”

During that discussion, Song adds to the narrative with a background moment, a quick introduction of the film’s third lead, John (Chris Evans), who walks through the frame while the two are talking.

“I really did want the sound design and the way that he walks by to be something that is maybe not easy to spot in the first watch, but it’s a bit of a secret.”

That moment pays off when Lucy tells Harry her drink order toward the end of the scene.

“Democracy is under assault right before our eyes — the moment we’ve feared has arrived,” he said in the speech.

Newsom spoke on the fifth day of protests in Los Angeles and shortly after the city’s mayor, Karen Bass, announced an overnight curfew for parts of downtown that she said she expected would last for several days.

66,The New York Times,-f-Ogzo2oc4,Watch Ana de Armas Fight Using Kitchen Utensils in ‘Ballerina’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"In one scene in “From the World of John Wick: Ballerina,” there may be too many assassins in the kitchen.

The film’s title character, the trained killer Eve (Ana de Armas), has made her way to an alpine village in Austria as part of a mission to root out a cult. But violent townspeople keep getting in her way. In a restaurant, Eve encounters a cook who aims to do more with her knife than julienne.

What follows is a brisk action scene in which kitchen utensils are wielded violently and plates are smashed frantically.

Narrating the scene, the director Len Wiseman said that during rehearsal, the goal was to “explore and use everything in a diner that could be used as a possible weapon.”

That included pans, a meat tenderizer and a pile of plates that became the centerpiece of the sequence, as the two performers are seen in an overhead shot smashing dishes over each other’s heads.

“This was one of the hardest things to do,” Wiseman said during an interview in New York, “because the plates are breakaway plates. They have one job. They break.” This meant that the actors had to be really careful picking up the plates, but also had to make the action look forceful.

In the end, Wiseman and his team just wanted to have a little fun with this sequence. “What I was going for,” he said, “is let’s have this one be violent, but also make people laugh.”
