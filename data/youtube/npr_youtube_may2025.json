It is a warning. They see this as a message that if you don't comply with what we're demanding, these will be the consequences,\u201d Harvard President Alan Garber told Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep.",

    "description":"With the Tony Awards scheduled for next weekend \u2014 Sunday, June 8 \u2014 Broadway has officially wrapped up a record-breaking season, bringing in $1.89 billion in box office grosses and a total attendance of 14.7 million \u2014 signs that Broadway seems to have recovered from its drought triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFive years ago, Broadway theaters were shuttered and, after an 18-month pause, box office sales and attendance numbers began their slow rebound. But this past season, Broadway posted its highest box office numbers to date \u2014 even if attendance was slightly behind the last season before the pandemic.\n\nThe numbers are partly due to the box office bonanza of a few high-profile productions of plays featuring big Hollywood stars \u2014 among them: Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhall (Othello), George Clooney (Good Night, and Good Luck) and Kieran Culkin (Glengarry Glen Ross). Those plays brought in more money in most weeks this season than big musicals like Wicked, Hamilton and The Lion King.",

Researchers were studying this tool use with wildlife cameras, and the cameras saw a young male capuchin carrying around a baby from a different species \u2014 a howler monkey. The capuchin did this repeatedly, carrying several howler babies until they died; then other immature males in the group started snatching howler babies too.\n\nIn the journal Current Biology, researchers say they believe the kidnappings started as a way to combat boredom on an island that has a lot of food and no predators \u2014 they say they can\u2019t see a reason for the kidnappings. The activity they caught on video shows how this species has a strong urge to try new things, and to copy each other.",

Noem said she does, but insisted the president can suspend it whenever he wants. Hassan argued it can only be suspended with Congress' approval.",

Public health experts say it was a great way to get healthcare to a lot of people for a low cost.\n\nThe Trump Administration has dramatically scaled back U.S. foreign aid to align with its America first agenda, and as a result many of the clinics were suddenly shuttered. That left many patients scrambling to get their medications, including 16-year old Catherine Mwaloe, who has been HIV positive since birth.\n\nHer grandmother, who has the same name, says Catherine has been grappling with why she has to take her HIV medication. \"It's been very difficult to get her to accept her situation. She says, 'What is it that I have done to get this illness?'\"\n\nNow, Catherine is struggling with where to find her medications. \"I've heard that... many millions of people going to die.\" She fears she will be one of them.",

It\u2019s piling up on beaches, and it could turn away tourists. The seaweed has already been seen in the Caribbean islands and in Mexico.\n\nIn the open sea, healthy patches of sargassum can soak up carbon dioxide and serve as a critical habitat for fish, crabs, shrimp, turtles and birds. But if sargassum moves closer to the coast, the seaweed can wreak havoc on local ecosystems, smothering coral reefs and altering the water's pH balance.\nSargassum begins to rot after about 48 hours on land, releasing irritants like hydrogen sulfide, a hazard to anyone with respiratory issues like asthma.",

Rather than ask the justices to outright reverse the lower courts, they instead asked the justices to narrow the lower court orders so that the administration could at least begin planning to put into effect its new policy against birthright citizenship.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow NPR elsewhere, too:\n\u2022 Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/npr\/\n\u2022 TikTok: https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@npr\n\u2022 Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NPR",

    "description":"In a somewhat surprising move, the Trump administration asked a federal court this week to dismiss a case that could seriously restrict access to abortion nationally.\n\nThe lawsuit from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri argues that FDA should roll back access to mifepristone, one of the pills used for medication abortion and for managing miscarriages. It\u2019s a case the Supreme Court declined to weigh in on last year, finding the plaintiffs lacked the right to sue. The three states later moved to revive the case, arguing they have legal standing because access to the drug undermines their abortion laws. On Monday, the Justice Department continued with the approach taken by the Biden administration, asking a federal judge to dismiss the case.\n\nKatie Keith, the director of the Georgetown Center for Health Policy and the Law and a former member of President Biden\u2019s Gender Policy Council, says if the Trump administration wants to restrict access, they have other tools at their disposal. What remains to be seen is whether, politically, they want to make use of those tools.\n\n\"I would say the jury is still out essentially of how aggressive the Trump administration is going to be on medication abortion.\"",

    "description":"The Trump administration is ending a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China, beginning today, affecting retailers like Shein and TEMU, making their goods much more expensive for American consumers.\n\nThere\u2019s been pressure since the Biden administration to end what\u2019s called the \u201cde minimus\u201d loophole, which meant packages valued at under $800 were not charged an import fee. More than 1 billion of these packages now come to the U.S. a year, mostly from China \u2014 a more than sixfold increase over the last decade.\n\nThe Trump administration says the rule change is an attempt at combating fentanyl trafficking \u2014 and to collect revenue for the government.",

    "description":"Morning Edition\u2019s Steve Inskeep spoke with Stephen K. Bannon this week. The sometime presidential adviser is one of many figures worth watching to see what Trump voters, and occasionally Trump himself, might be thinking.\n\nThough Bannon has a Harvard MBA and made money on Wall Street and in Hollywood, he describes himself as a defender of the working class. He's cast doubt on the effectiveness of Elon Musk, the billionaire presidential aide, saying he wants an \"audit\" of purported savings by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nBannon also calls for higher taxes on the wealthy to help reduce federal debt, an idea that Trump has toyed with but not endorsed.",
