0,VICE,KyS079s6tS0,He Filmed Your Favorite Skate Videos: The Jon Miner Story | Let It Kill You,"If you were a skateboarder in the early 2000s, chances are you grew up on Jon Miner’s work. The visionary behind iconic projects like This is Skateboarding, Kids in Emerica, Stay Gold, and more, Miner helped define a generation of skate videos. Skaters couldn’t get enough of his signature look and feel — raw, stylish, unforgettable.

To kick off Season 2 of Let It Kill You, series creator Ben McQueen heads to Santa Rosa to dive into Jon’s personal life, tracing his journey through stories, memories, and candid moments. Jon gets real — personal, vulnerable, and unfiltered — opening up about skateboarding, life, and what it takes to be one of the best skateboarders to ever step behind the camera.

From Andrew Reynolds to Heath Kirchart, hear from the legends themselves as they reflect on what made working with Jon so special.

7,VICE,upa3VoxBwHw,This honey makes people hallucinate,"Nepal’s Gurung people live mostly in small villages in the vast Annapurna mountain ranges. In this remote region, they practice an ancient tradition of honey hunting where they descend towering cliffs on handmade ladders, to harvest honey nestled under jagged overhangs. 

In spring, the Gurung’s honey contains a rare substance called grayanotoxin from rhododendron flowers that’s known for its intoxicating effects. While some accounts say it’s a deadly poison, others refer to it as an aphrodisiac, powerful medicine, and a hallucinogenic drug.
