The writings of Machiavelli are a rare exception.\n\nWhy are we still talking about Machiavelli, nearly 500 years after his death? What is it about his political philosophy that feels so important, prescient, or maybe chilling today?\n\nIn this episode, Sean speaks with political philosopher and writer Erica Benner about Niccolo Machiavelli\u2019s legacy. The two discuss The Prince, Machiavelli\u2019s views on democracy, and what he might say about the Trump administration were he alive today.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Get good grades. Get into a good school. Get a good job. Be ambitious about earning a high salary or a high-status position.\n\nSome of us love this endless climb. But lots of us, at least once in our lives, find ourselves asking, \"What\u2019s the point of all this ambition?\"\n\nHistorian and author Rutger Bregman doesn\u2019t think there is a point to that kind of ambition. Instead, he wants us to be morally ambitious, to measure the value of our achievements based on how much good we do, by how much we improve the world.\n\nIn this episode, Bregman speaks with guest host Sigal Samuel about how to know if you\u2019re morally ambitious, the value of surrounding yourself with like-minded people, and how to make moral ambition fashionable.\n\n00:00 Intro\n2:55 Interview\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http:\/\/goo.gl\/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Become a Vox Member today: http:\/\/www.vox.com\/memberships\n\nUniversal pre-K, an ambitious social program usually championed by progressives, has been in place in one of the most conservative US states since 1998. Oklahoma\u2019s universal pre-k program was just the second in the country (behind Georgia) and has since become a model for how these programs can boost school readiness, economic well-being, and community health. \n\nThe story of how Oklahoma enacted this big early childhood education program involves a little bit of political mischief, and a lot of motivated educators who saw a need for high quality pre-kindergarten in the 90s, and made it happen. \n\nWe went to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to hear from the people who were there at the beginning of this beloved program, and the ones carrying it forward in pre-kindergarten classrooms in Oklahoma today. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (\ud83d\udd14) so you don't miss any videos:   https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nCheck out your state\u2019s progress toward preschool for all in NIEER\u2019s 2024 \u201cState of Preschool Yearbook\u201d\nhttps:\/\/nieer.org\/yearbook\/2024\n\nThe Early Childhood Education Institute has a published a wealth of research analyzing Oklahoma\u2019s early childhood education programs: \nhttps:\/\/www.ou.edu\/tulsa\/early-childhood-education-institute\n\nWilliam Gormley studied Tulsa\u2019s pre-K program for more than 20 years for Georgetown University.
