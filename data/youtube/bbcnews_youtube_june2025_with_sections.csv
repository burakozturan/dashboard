Thousands were killed, and the UN estimated 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed.

In recent months, videos and reels from several pro-Russia influencers have been painting a picture of a glossy city where damaged structures have been repaired and where life has gone back to normal.

But the BBC has spoken to more than half a dozen people - some still living in Mariupol, others who escaped after spending time under occupation - to piece together a real picture of what life is like in the city.

12,BBC News,Baq7SJN8VQ8,UN nuclear watchdog warns that Iran could resume enriching uranium within months | BBC News,"Iran has the capacity to start enriching uranium again - for a possible bomb - in ""a matter of months"", the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog has said.

Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said US strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites had caused severe but ""not total"" damage to the enrichment programme.

That contradicts claims by US President Donald Trump that the US bombing had “totally obliterated” the nuclear facilities. 

Meanwhile Iran’s deputy foreign minister has told the BBC that the US must rule out any further strikes on Iran if it wants to resume diplomatic talks.  Majid Takht-Ravanchi says the Trump administration has told Iran through mediators it wants to return to negotiations, but had ""not made their position clear"" on the ""very important question"" of whether they might conduct further attacks while talks are taking place.

Israel attacked nuclear and military sites in Iran on 13 June, claiming Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon.
The US later joined the strikes, dropping bombs on three of Iran's nuclear facilities: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.
Since then, the true extent of the damage has been unclear.

The IAEA assessment comes after a leaked US intelligence report also concluded that the strikes had probably only set back the programme by months. 

Trump retorted furiously to that, declaring that Iran's nuclear sites were ""completely destroyed"" and accusing the media of ""an attempt to demean one of the most successful military strikes in history"".

The Israeli Embassy posted on X that it was ""deeply disturbed by the inflammatory and hateful rhetoric"".

The festival said in a statement: “Glastonbury Festival does not condone hate speech or incitement to violence of any kind from its performers.""

We also hear from Health Secretary Wes Streeting on the issue, and on the upcoming welfare vote in the House of Commons.

According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, in the past month more than 500 people on their way to get aid have been killed and 4,000 injured.
 
To get a clearer understanding of how the last month has unfolded, BBC Verify has analysed dozens of videos from across Gaza that offer an insight into what this aid system looked like on the ground. 
 
Footage shows a near-daily cycle of chaos, panic, live gunfire and dead or injured Palestinians.
 
In statements over the past month, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have several times said they fired ""warning shots"" at individuals who they described as ""suspects"" or said posed a threat.
 
But criticism remains with one medical charity saying the US and Israeli- backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is 'slaughter masquerading as aid'.

36,BBC News,CeD0XiP2HUs,Iran’s Supreme Leader says US strikes on nuclear sites achieved nothing | BBC News,"Iran's supreme leader has insisted the US ""gained no achievements"" from strikes on its nuclear facilities, in his first public address since a ceasefire with Israel was agreed.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the strikes did not ""accomplish anything significant"" to disrupt Iran's nuclear programme, and said his country’s retaliation against an American air base in Qatar had dealt a ""heavy blow"" to the United States.

It came as Washington doubled down on its assessment that the strikes had severely undermined Iran's nuclear ambitions.  US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said intelligence gathered by the US and Israel indicated the operation ""significantly damaged the nuclear programme, setting it back by years"".

Previously, US President Donald Trump said the strikes against three key nuclear sites inside Iran ""totally obliterated"" them.  He gad also responded furiously to a leaked US intelligence report which suggested that Iran’s uranium enrichment programme had only been set back by a few months. 

Hegseth said the mission was a ""historic success"" and that the the enrichment facilities were now “inoperable"".
He said said the US was ""not aware of any intelligence"" which indicated the enriched uranium had been moved out of once facility, Fordo, prior to the Us attack.

Its government has approved new measures that went into effect on Wednesday restricting the sale of the drug to those with a doctor's prescription, in the hope of helping regulate an industry some describe as out of control.
 
The south-east Asian nation's public health minister has also said that consumption of marijuana will be criminalised again, although it's unclear when that could happen.
 
Ever since the drug was decriminalised in 2022, there has been a frenzy of investment. There are now around 11,000 registered cannabis dispensaries in Thailand.
 
So far this year, 173 people accused of smuggling cannabis – nearly all from Thailand – have gone through the court system in the UK and received sentences totalling 230 years.

42,BBC News,yyRMus9bouo,Inside Colombia’s booming sexcam industry | BBC News,"Warning: Contains descriptions of sexual exploitation

This BBC investigation reveals exploitation and abuse in the booming global webcam sex industry, where live sexual performances are streamed to millions of men worldwide. 

With nearly 15 billion views across major platforms last year, the demand is enormous - and so are the consequences.

This story offers rare access and powerful first-hand accounts, exposing the darker realities of one of the fastest-growing sectors of the global sex industry.

60,BBC News,QjdEHFULexI,BREAKING: Leaked US intelligence says Iran’s nuclear plans “likely only set back months” | BBC News,"A leaked Pentagon intelligence report says the US strikes on Iran’s key nuclear facilities has probably only set back its enrichment programme by months.

President Trump claimed after the bombing that the US attack had “completely obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme.

The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the report “flat out wrong” and said “the leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran’s nuclear program”.

The initial classified assessment by the US Defence Intelligence Agency said two of the sites were not destroyed and concludes that key elements of the programme to enrich uranium may soon restart. 

It says  that much of Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, which could possibly be used to make a nuclear weapon, was moved before the strikes took place. 

The development came as a ceasefire between Israel and Iran appeared to be holding, after President Trump lashed out at Israel for its failure to abide by the terms of the truce.

Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, initially fell to $68 a barrel though it then recovered some ground after Iran and Israel accused each other of violating the ceasefire within hours.

Prices had spiked in recent days as concerns grew that Tehran could disrupt global supplies by blockading the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping route for oil and gas.
Stock markets in the US, the UK and Europe rose and held steady after US President Donald Trump told Israel on social media not to drop bombs after it accused Iran of breaching the ceasefire.

Just hours earlier, Trump had declared the ceasefire was ""now in effect"", after which Israel confirmed that it had agreed to the move.

106,BBC News,bTME7W0cIEQ,Why Trump’s Iran decision is splitting the Republican Party | BBC Americast,"As the world waits for Donald Trump’s decison on whether to join Israel in striking Iran’s nuclear sites, he is quickly losing support from his own party. Donald Trump has generally enjoyed party unity since returning to office in January but now faces an open revolt over the possibility of US strikes against Iran. 

Some of Trump’s biggest supporters, including the Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, have publicly come out against the prospect of war with Iran. Why are some of his MAGA supporters against military involvement, and does it fit with the ‘America First’ agenda? 

Sarah, Justin and Anthony discuss how the legacy of America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan loom over the current situation with Iran, and whether Donald Trump even needs the support of his party to join the Israel-Iran conflict. 

And Justin speaks to Elliott Abrams, who served as Special Representative for Iran from 2020 to 2021, during Donald Trump’s first term. He was also an Assistant Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. In 1992, Abrams was pardoned after he was convicted of misleading Congress about out the Iran-Contra affair, which involved the secret sale of arms to Iran.

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, Mikey Kay, host of the Security Brief on BBC News, and BBC World Service Middle East correspondent Nafiseh Kohnavard answer your questions on the Iran-Israel conflict.
 
Israel launched a surprise attack last week that it says killed many top Iranian military commanders and atomic scientists. However, Israel does not appear to have achieved its goal of destroying Iran's nuclear development programme.
 
Israeli strikes have killed at least 224 people in Iran, according to the Iranian health ministry. In Israel, the government said at least 24 people had died.

140,BBC News,xaPhkXmnleI,Smuggling gangs switch tactics to use 'taxi boats' for journeys across the Channel | BBC News,"French police are struggling to halt a potentially record-breaking surge of people from reaching the UK in small boats organised by a growing network of smuggling gangs. 
 
Downing Street has said the situation is “deteriorating.""
 
Although the French authorities claim they’re now intercepting more than two thirds of those boats before they reach the sea, the smugglers are now changing tactics to launch so-called “taxi-boats” from new sites, in new ways, and with ever greater speed. 
 
Instead of inflating their boats in the dunes along the coast, close to police patrols, the gangs are launching them from better hidden locations, often dozens of kilometres from the main departure beaches. 
 
They then cruise along the coastline, like taxis or buses, picking up their paying customers who now wait in the sea, out of reach of the police.
 
Andrew Harding reports from Calais.

143,BBC News,149NU9RmiyA,Iran's Supreme Leader says he will never compromise with Israel | BBC News,"Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran ""will never compromise with Zionists"", in a series of posts on X.
 
""We will show the Zionists no mercy,"" a translation of the post reads. In a different post, he says ""the battle begins"".

Israel said it struck a centrifuge site in Tehran and weapons facilities as part of its overnight barrage, whilst Iran launched its own attacks on Israel, with sirens sounding twice overnight.

Israeli military officials said strikes which took place last Friday were a pre-emptive attack, to damage Iran’s nuclear programme, as Iran was reaching “the point of no return”, though they have provided no evidence of that. 

The latest assessments of the international community, including from the US, have indicated that Iran had not made a decision to weaponize its nuclear programme, something it had abandoned in 2003.

Iran, a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), says it has the right to a peaceful nuclear programme, and has consistently denied it is seeking a nuclear weapon.

Writing on Truth Social, the US President stated:  “We know exactly where the so-called Supreme Leader is hiding”, and described Ayatollah Khamenei as an “easy target”.  Mr Trump said: “we are not going to take him out (kill!),  at least not for now"".  He went on to say “our patience is wearing thin”.  In another post he demanded Iran's ""unconditional surrender"". 

Mr Trump held a meeting with his national security advisers at the White House as more US warplanes headed for the Middle East.   There’s mounting speculation that the US could join Israel directly in its war with Iran, which began five days ago with Israeli attacks on nuclear sites.    Israel has said its aim is to prevent Iran building a nuclear weapon.  However many of Iran’s nuclear sites are deep underground and only the US has weapons powerful enough to threaten them. 

Millions of Iranians have been fleeing the capital Tehran where there have been reports of more explosions, with major roads out of the city gridlocked.    Iran warned people in Israel to evacuate the cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa.

Newsom called it “the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president,” while Trump claimed LA “would be burning to the ground” without his intervention.

Adam is joined by chief anchor for BBC News Sumi Somaskanda, and host of the Coming Storm Gabriel Gatehouse.

And, the prime minister has said he is ""not writing a blank cheque"" to pay for a new UK nuclear power plant, after the government announced it would commit £14.2bn to the project. Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC the development of Sizewell C on the Suffolk coastline would create 10,000 jobs over the next decade, and provide energy security and independence for the country. Adam is joined by Adam Bell, the former head of energy strategy at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

The protests began when Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers began carrying out raids across the city, detaining many people who have lived and worked in Los Angeles for years.

US president Donald Trump posted on social media: ""Looking really bad in LA. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!"", having called in the National Guard - against the wishes of California's governor, Gavin Newsom.

This is reportedly the first time the National Guard has been activated without request of the state's governor since 1965.

National Guard troops have been stationed outside the Metropolitan detention centre, one of several sites that have seen confrontations involving hundreds of demonstrators and federal law enforcement officials.

It’s the first time a US president has deployed the National Guard in the face of civil unrest since the LA riots in 1992.   President Trump said: “We'll send whatever we need to make sure there's law and order.”

However Mr Trump’s Democrat opponents have said the administration's use of masked immigration officers with military gear to arrest civilians in restaurants and shops has been inflammatory and the president's eagerness to deploy trained soldiers was unwarranted.

Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the Austrian World Summit, organised by the Schwarzenegger's Climate Initiative, he said the US President could not prevent progress on tackling the threat of global warming. 

Donald Trump has reversed many US initiatives to support the environment and pulled out of international agreements to tackle climate change.

He said people needed to understand the obstacles to change but not use them as an excuse for inaction.

261,BBC News,3fcR3BKTttA,US President Donald Trump ’not interested’ in making up with Elon Musk | BBC News,"US President Donald Trump has said he is “not interested” in making up with tech billionaire Elon Musk in the wake of their online feud.
 
Since leaving the White House, Musk has been voicing opposition to Trump’s budget bill, which in turn led to Trump suggesting that he may cancel contracts with Musk’s companies.
 
Tesla shares were sent into freefall on Thursday - falling 14% - as the social media back-and-forth escalated, and while they rebounded a little on Friday, there is little sign of reconciliation between the two.

277,BBC News,8vg2D3Pi9Rk,Trump-Musk row explodes as billionaire claims President named in Epstein files | BBC News,"The political partnership between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has exploded  in spectacular fashion into a bitter war of words.

It began when Mr Trump said he was “surprised and disappointed” at Elon Musk’s criticism of his flagship spending bill.   He said they had had a “great relationship” but “I don’t know if we will any more”. 

Elon Musk responded on his social media platform X with a series of increasingly heated remarks about his former boss.   He said the President’s claims that he has supported the budget bill were “false”.   He said Mr Trump was  “ungrateful” for his help in getting elected and would have lost the election without his financial support.   Mr Musk warned that the President’s tariffs policy would lead to a recession.

Then Musk made an explosive allegation, claiming without evidence that Donald Trump is named in the files about the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  He said that “is the real reason they have not been made public”.

Donald Trump suggested that the easiest way to save money would be to terminate the billions of dollars in government contracts and subsidies that go to Elon Musk’s companies.   Musk said that President Trump should be impeached.

289,BBC News,R0woU7dnxqs,Putin will avenge destruction of Russian warplanes by Ukraine warns Donald Trump | BBC News,"Vladimir Putin has said he will respond “very strongly” to Ukraine's major drone attack on Russian airbases, US President Donald Trump has warned.

Speaking after a phone call with the Russian president, Trump said: ""President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.""  Moscow said that military options were ""on the table"".

Trump also said that his phone call Putin would not ""lead to immediate peace"" between Russia and Ukraine. Russian state media said Putin told Trump that Ukraine has tried to ""disrupt"" negotiations and that the government in Kyiv has ""essentially turned into a terrorist organisation"".

It was the first conversation between the two leaders since Ukraine launched its surprise attack on Russian military airbases using drones, destroying what it said were nuclear-capable long-range bombers.  Trump is reported to have told Putin in the call that the US was not warned in advance of the attack.

A week ago Trump appeared to set a two-week deadline for Putin, threatening to change how the US is responding to Russia if he believed Putin was ""tapping"" him along on peace efforts in Ukraine.  It was one of a string of critical remarks by Trump, who on 26 May said that Putin had gone ""absolutely crazy"" and was ""playing with fire"", after Russia stepped up drone and missile attacks on cities in Ukraine, killing dozens of civilians. 

The leaders’ phone call comes days after a second round of direct peace talks in Istanbul between the warring sides ended without a breakthrough, although they agreed to swap more prisoners of war. Ukrainian negotiators said Russia had rejected an ""unconditional ceasefire”,  a key demand of Kyiv and its Western allies including the US.

328,BBC News,e4IfXmK9DpM,Ukrainian drones strike airbases across Russia destroying dozens of warplanes| BBC News,"In a spectacular military and propganda coup, Ukraine has carried out an audacious attack on Russia’s airforce, using drones to destroy as many as 40 warplanes at military bases across the country.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the so-called ""Spider's Web"" operation by the SBU security service.  They were smuggled into Russia hidden in wooden mobile cabins, moved close to the airbases, then launched by remote control.  Ukrainian sources told BBC News it had taken 18 months to plan and carry out the operation. 

Russia confirmed the Ukrainian attacks, calling them a ""terrorist act"".   Ukraine claims it caused $7bn in damage and destroyed many of Russia’s strategic bomber aircraft.
