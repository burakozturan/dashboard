An 11-week Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid has pushed the enclave\u2019s population of more than 2 million Palestinians towards famine and into a deepening humanitarian crisis, with the first resumption of humanitarian aid trickling into the besieged enclave last week.\n\nVideos from the distribution site in Tel al-Sultan, run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), showed large crowds rushing the facilities, tearing down some of the fencing and appearing to climb over barriers designed to control the flow of the crowd. On Wednesday, Palestinian health officials said one person had been shot dead and 48 wounded during the chaos. The person who was killed died of severe injuries at the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah, the officials said. #CNN #News",

    "description":"President Donald Trump on Saturday said Walmart needs to stop \u201ctrying to blame tariffs\u201d after the retail giant announced its products would become more expensive.\n\nWalmart\u2019s CEO said the price increases were a result of Trump\u2019s tariffs being \u201ctoo high,\u201d particularly when it came to Chinese goods.\n\n\u201cWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren\u2019t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,\u201d Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon said Thursday in an earnings call.\n\nTrump responded on Saturday, posting to Truth Social that \u201cBetween Walmart and China they should, as is said \u2018EAT THE TARIFFS,\u2019 and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I\u2019ll be watching, and so will your customers!\u201d #CNN #News",
