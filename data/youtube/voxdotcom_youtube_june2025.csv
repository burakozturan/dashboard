Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Whatâ€™s the point of college if no oneâ€™s actually doing the work? Itâ€™s not a rhetorical question. In the age of AI, it's incredibly easy for students to offload their assignments. AI tools can write essays, make study guides, and even complete whole assignments.
So what is the point of higher education?

In todayâ€™s episode, Sean speaks with journalist James Walsh about his recent article, ""Everyone is Cheating Their Way Through College."" The two discuss how students are using AI to finish their assignments, how colleges are (and arenâ€™t) responding to these challenges, and whether you can learn to think when something else does the thinking for you.

3,Vox,eds_MxfNw5Q,Should small towns still have volunteer EMS?,"The US volunteer fire and ambulance shortage, explained.

Thanks to our sponsor, T-Mobile: http://t-mobile.com/FirstResponders

In US small towns, emergency fire and ambulance first responder agencies are still mostly staffed by volunteers â€“ a practice put in place in the 1970s and 1980s. But these volunteers are increasingly older, with fewer young people signing up than previous decades. Higher cost of living and a diminishing rural population has made volunteering less appealing than it used to be. We interviewed experts in the field of emergency response to figure out how to get those volunteers back, and the answer may be a simple one: pay them for their time.

Ellen didnâ€™t leave a way to get in contact with her, but itâ€™s a good question! So we thought weâ€™d get to the bottom of it, on behalf of all Ellenâ€™s who may have ever wondered this same thing.

In this video, we break down what probiotics actually are, whether they do what they claim, and how yogurt fits into the picture. Are all yogurts probiotic? Are probiotics even worth it? Or is it all just a marketing scam? 

To find out, I talked to a few experts, dug into the research, and ate more yogurt than I thought possible.

11,Vox,3onNLEpMZ00,How America is failing its rural hospitals,"Why so many rural hospitals keep closing.

Thanks to our sponsor, T-Mobile: http://t-mobile.com/FirstResponders

Over the past 20 years, nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed, and experts warn that another 700 are at risk of closure in the near future. To put that in context, Texas alone has seen 25 hospital closures since 2005. If nothing is done, the state could lose over half the remaining small town hospitals. That means people are driving further for care, sometimes over an hour, or waiting longer to get help. These delays could lead to worse health outcomes. 

Nationwide, an estimated 20% of the US population lives in rural areas. Other estimates found that 80% of counties across the US lack adequate access to health care. Unlike their urban counterparts, small town hospitals are often the entire health care system for the community, meaning they provide a wide range of services from lab tests and screening to basic primary care. When one shuts down, it means the surrounding community could lose access to all health care. There is bipartisan support to assist rural communities, and Congress has passed a number of bills over the decades to try to keep these facilities open, but it still isnâ€™t enough. So why are so many rural hospitals shutting down?

Itâ€™s a multifaceted issue that comes back again and again to income. At its core, a hospital is a business and, often, not a very lucrative one. One recent report found that over 50% of rural hospitals are operating at a deficit. The slightest change in income could be the difference between staying open and having to shut their doors for good. Watch the piece above to learn more.

This piece is a small bite of a huge topic. Check out other pieces from Vox.comâ€™s Dylan Scott to learn more about the challenges rural hospitals face:

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

For decades, the American right has stayed on brand: the economy. Low taxes. Free markets. Deregulation. Those have been the buzzwords for more than half a century. But that doctrine is now being challenged by other conservatives who envision a future in which Americaâ€™s trade deficit is lower, manufacturing returns to the US, and Americans buy more American-made products.
Is this future even possible?

Economist Oren Cass thinks it is. In todayâ€™s episode, the founder of the think tank America Compass speaks to Sean about right-wing economic populism. The two discuss a conservative, pro-worker approach to economic policy, Cassâ€™s plan to bring manufacturing back to the US, and what types of behavior economic policy should incentivize.

16,Vox,pWRlDIBoQW4,How the US created an ambulance crisis,"And what can be done about it.

Thanks to our sponsor, T-Mobile: http://t-mobile.com/FirstResponders

Here's a pretty obvious statement: In the more rural, spread-out parts of the US, an ambulance will typically take a while to get to you. Makes sense. Driving a longer distance takes longer.

Here's the catch: other emergency services like police and fire don't actually have this same problem; it's relatively unique to ambulances. It turns out that emergency response time is about a little more than distance. Something is different about ambulances that is slowing them down in rural areas of the US.

That difference starts with the ways that ambulance services are funded in most of the US: Instead of being paid for by taxes like police and fire services are, ambulances are often paid for by a sort of a la carte model â€” the more people they take to the hospital, the more they get reimbursed. It's a model that works well for emergency services in densely populated areas, but less well for everyone else. In this video, we look at how exactly that translates into longer response times, and what can be done to fix it.

Note: A previous version of this video contained an incorrect graphic at 6:00. The graphic has been removed.
