26,Washington Post,PPG7itZ39DY,Ceasefire,"On the final episode of Sidebar, The Washington Post's Libby Casey, Rhonda Colvin, James Hohmann and JM Rieger breakdown the shaky ceasefire between Iran and Israel – and whether it will hold. And having decided to enter the conflict, President Trump is now trying to play peacemaker.

Then, the crew breaks down Trump's stunning turn of fortune since Sidebar began – from being found guilty in his New York hush money and election interference trial, to winning the presidency for a second time and seeing his federal charges dismissed.

Later, the crew reflects on their time hosting Sidebar and other Washington Post coverage.

13:50 Is Netanyahu getting what he wants in this conflict?
18:30 Trump heads to NATO summit next
22:38 How Trump became the luckiest man in politics
30:52 How Republicans are sticking with Trump

91,Washington Post,7hR7FJj0vZw,"Gov. Josh Shapiro, victim of political violence: 'We can't be deterred'","Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) faced a violent attack on his home in April. 

A man with a history of mental illness, 38-year-old Cody Balmer, has been charged with breaking in and setting fire to a dining room at the Governor’s Residence. The alleged arsonist said part of his motivation was Shapiro’s support for Israel and that he intended to bludgeon the governor to death with a sledgehammer. This interview is Shapiro's first focused on that night since the immediate aftermath of the attack.

Since this incident, there have been other high-profile attacks against Jewish people in Boulder, Colorado, and Washington, D.C.

Host Colby Itkowitz speaks with Shapiro about the attack and the recent spike in antisemitic actions in the United States. She also asks him about President Donald Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines to California, and why so many people think he’s a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028.

Shapiro spoke with Post Reports before Saturday's devastating incident of political violence, when a gunman killed a Minnesota state representative and her husband and shot and injured a state senator and his wife. But later, Shapiro said in a statement that “this is unacceptable — we all have a responsibility to stand up and work to defeat the political violence that is tearing through our country. America is better than this.""

175,Washington Post,NWxolxlVRq0,Is Trump chickening out on foreign policy?,"Some investors on Wall Street are starting to call President Trump’s bluffs on tariffs — coining the acronym TACO, for “Trump Always Chickens Out.” But will Trump make good on his promises to end the conflict in Ukraine, strike a deal with Iran and make nice with China?

176,Washington Post,H5pqd0ltk4k,Republicans' risky fight on health care,"On this episode, The Washington Post's Libby Casey, Rhonda Colvin and James Hohmann break down some of the most controversial provisions in Republicans' giant spending and immigration bill: Provisions that would affect Medicare and the Affordable Care Act.

While the bill has already passed the GOP-controlled House, it might have a tougher time getting through the Senate, where some Republican senators have already expressed doubts – like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Ark.), who has said it is “wrong to cut Medicaid for the working poor.”

Plus, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) told a town hall last week that ""we all are going to die,"" then doubled down in an Instagram video on Saturday. Is that a politically risky move – or just what Trump would do?
