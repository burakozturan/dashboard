72,MSNBC,rBuc24vsyhs,SCOTUS guts nationwide blocks on Trump’s orders,"In a new ruling, Trump v. CASA, the Supreme Court’s supermajority limited the ability of federal judges to issue universal injunctions–orders that block potentially unlawful policies nationwide until courts can decide their legality. At the center of the case is Trump’s executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Now, the Supreme Court has ruled that in most cases, judges can only block policies for the specific plaintiffs before them– leaving millions unprotected while lawsuits make their way through the courts. The decision fits into the Court’s broader pattern of expanding executive power.

73,MSNBC,uTn2piIOIlA,‘More empty homes in America than there are homeless people’: Affordability agenda drives NY primary,"Critics debate whether the primary win of Zohran Mamdani is a referendum on the future of the Democratic party. One thing is certain – he clearly struck a nerve with voters, and it’s that Americans can barely afford to live in this country. Author and economics professor Andre Perry argues that nothing will be affordable if wages can’t keep pace with rising costs. He notes that New York City has “lost 75,000 middle income jobs” just in the last year. According to radio show host and NYT best-selling author, Thom Hartmann, the housing crisis has been driven in part by giant corporations buying up properties and driving up costs, stating when prices “you start to see homelessness explode in these communities.”

74,MSNBC,qM2-qzoRC6Y,‘It’s a lawless process’: NYC Comptroller Brad Lander on ICE Arrests at Immigration Courts,"Seeing people show up to defend immigrants can inspire doubt and dissent even among those tasked with enforcing ICE’s edicts, says NYC Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a Manhattan immigration court on June 17, revealing that “the ICE agent who arrested me confessed to me afterwards that his wife hopes he quits his job.” Lander, who also ran in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, was one of many people across the country, including a Catholic bishop in San Diego and National Guard members in Chicago, who are accompanying immigrants to their hearings in response to ICE’s new tactic of arresting people on their way to and from court proceedings. The comptroller describes seeing people detained by ICE agents after being given asylum hearing dates and encourages Americans to show up and bear witness. “You have the right to sit in the courtroom and see what's happening, and that's your right as a person in this democracy,” Lander says.

75,MSNBC,fsa48FU7xiA,Velshi Banned Book Club: “World War Z” by Max Brooks,"Max Brooks’ seminal zombie thriller, “World War Z”, is set in an alternate 21st century world after a zombie apocalypse -- a pandemic that began in a small Chinese village -- infected and subsequently killed millions. Told through a series of interviews, all conducted by a fictional version of Brooks, there is very intentionally no hero. Each interview subject is a survivor of the apocalypse, each with a different role to play. While “World War Z” grapples with human shortsightedness, the power of fear, the fragility of modern life, the necessity of humanity in the face of chaos, at its core, it is a book about survival.

The 6-3 ruling from the conservative majority Supreme Court limited the ability of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions – one of the key tools that the judicial branch had in its checks and balances on an executive branch that they believe is exceeding its lawful authority. Andrea Flores, Vice President for Immigration Policy and Campaigns at FWD.US and Skye Perryman, President & CEO of Democracy Forward join The Weekend to discuss their plan to handle litigation following the Supreme Court’s birthright citizenship ruling.

Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) pressed Emil Bove — a former Trump defense attorney and current DOJ official nominated for a circuit court judgeship — over allegations that he encouraged DOJ lawyers to ignore court orders to advance the president’s agenda.

335,MSNBC,ZbUHHfesDyg,'It's not clear to me what the admin. is hiding from the Congress': Jeffries on U.S. Iran strikes,"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said that he has requested a briefing for top lawmakers in Congress on the situation in Iran, but one hasn't happened yet. He then accused the Trump administration of hiding information related to Iran from Congress.

“And it’s not clear to me what the administration is hiding from the Congress and from the American people,” Jeffries said. “If they have a case to make, come up to Capitol Hill and make it.”

Asked for comment, the White House pointed to remarks this morning from press secretary Karoline Leavitt who told reporters that Trump officials did call Democrats about the situation in Iran. The White House, however, didn't address whether a formal briefing would be provided as they typically take place on Capitol Hill amid major events.

Sons of b***hes, instead of leaving the people alone and working there,” he said in Spanish in a video posted to his Instagram Stories.

NPR reports that ICE has adopted more aggressive tactics in Puerto Rico under the current Trump administration. In an interview with the outlet, Rebecca González-Ramos, head of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico, said nearly 500 immigrants have been arrested for deportation on the island over the past four months.

It’s unclear whether those filmed in Bad Bunny’s Instagram video were federal agents or if an ICE operation was underway.

On a holiday that commemorates the ending of slavery, Trump chose to gripe that there are “too many non-working holidays.” “What we’re seeing right now is the latest iteration of a country trying to forget its past,“ laments Princeton’s Eddie Glaude – trying to disremember”. But whether the Trump administration recognizes Juneteenth or not, “this tradition that’s been a part of African American history will continue on.” That resilience, according to Fordham’s Christina Greer, follows a long history of Black Americans “finding joy” where they can.

418,MSNBC,I2Rb_v6nCIw,Velshi Banned Book Club: ‘Olive’s Ocean’ by Kevin Henkes,"Olive's Ocean by the multiple award-winning author Kevin Henkes (also of ‘Chrysanthemum’, ‘Lilly’s Purple Plastic Purse,’ and others) grapples with family dynamics, death, and the healing power of nature – but at its core, it's a coming of age story. It's an examination of how intrinsically linked adolescence and mortality are – more specifically, the awareness of mortality. It is hard to believe that this book spent nearly a decade climbing the American Library Association's List of 100 most challenged books. Including just a few curse words and a single allusion to sex made by Martha's 14 year old brother, the book is a window into young people's lives. “It's about the enduring bonds of family, the wisdom of the older generation, the importance of not judging someone and prejudging them and getting to know them,” says Henkes. “It's about a kid who's trying to figure out where she belongs, a kid who's trying to be understood. And the love is the operating principle – the foundation and the spine that supports everything.”

600,MSNBC,lHxPJhT7seA,'Violent rhetoric' and 'misinformation': Wallace reacts to controversial posts on Minnesota attacks,"""A confrontation in the hallways of Capitol Hill...is speaking volumes today about the toxic stew that permeates there.

And, she argues, there are ways to fix it. But what Donald Trump is doing is no solution. Federalizing California’s National guard was “simply outrageous,” she says. And the president’s decision to deploy active duty Marines to the streets of Los Angeles to quell protests against ICE raids “is really crossing a red line.” She makes the case that a multi-prong approach is needed, including congressional reform. ""We have to decide on some way that those who have been in the country in an undocumented fashion, for years, many of them, can somehow get right with the law so that we're not breaking up families.""

721,MSNBC,9IBdZmr-h6E,Resistance or bust: Military troops in U.S. cities signal a national inflection point,"Thousands of U.S. troops have been deployed to Los Angeles in response to largely peaceful demonstrations against ICE raids. Donald Trump’s presidential memo authorizing the National Guard's deployment stops short of invoking the Insurrection Act. But the legal debate over whether he’s formally invoked it may be beside the point. In practice, Trump is already behaving as if he holds those emergency powers. Author and radio host Thom Hartmann warns this is an inflection point for the country. America’s current oligarchic phase will give way to one of two paths, he argues: full-blown autocracy, or mass resistance. And when that resistance begins, Hartmann says, the oligarchs face a choice: “Are we going to bring down the fist—or are we going to back off? And so far, what we are seeing is the fist.” This moment, Hartmann adds, is a moment of decision–“for the country, for the oligarchs, and for all of us.”

1088,MSNBC,OMaVUyboVG8,Evan Osnos: Billionaire influence in politics ‘doesn’t look a whole lot like democracy’,"Donald Trump, the president of the United States, is a billionaire. He got elected with the help of Elon Musk, the world’s richest man. Trump then appointed thirteen of his fellow billionaires to his cabinet. The rich are richer than ever, and their influence over politics and society is greater than ever. Evan Osnos, staff writer for The New Yorker and author of the new book “The Haves and the Have-Yachts: Dispatches on the Ultrarich” says that when billionaires have so much sway, “that doesn’t look a whole lot like democracy.” While Trump and Musk may be at odds now, Osnos notes that Musk’s complaints about the president sound “like he was complaining about buying a defective product.” Musk’s recent comments, Osnos says, may read to future historians as “the Rosetta Stone of how our democracy got so damaged.” -

One prosecutor in West Virginia even went so far as to suggest women call law enforcement after having a miscarriage to avoid prosecution. Amanda Zurawski, lead plaintiff in the Texas case that included 20 women who were denied emergency care, called this suggestion “reprehensible” and “terrifying.” NYU Professor Melissa Murray says that if having an abortion is going to be considered criminal behavior, that prosecutor just invited pregnant women to incriminate themselves.

We take a closer look at this massive tax plan that gives permanent breaks for the wealthy while slashing Medicaid, food assistance, and clean energy programs. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, it would add at least $2.4 trillion to the national deficit–hardly a win for fiscal conservatives. Even Elon Musk slammed it as a “disgusting abomination.” Meanwhile, Republican economists call out its fantasy math, while many GOP senators worry about the political backlash back home.

1121,MSNBC,ZhgMdCyGhXs,Velshi Banned Book Club: ‘Animal Farm’ by George Orwell,"When the animals on Manor Farm overthrow the farmer who lords over them, they dream of a utopia built on an inclusive mission: all animals are equal. But power is corrupting, and soon an autocratic pig seizes control and imposes a new creed on the farm: All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. That is the premise of today’s Velshi Banned Book Club feature, one of the most salient political satires ever written: “Animal Farm” by George Orwell. Orwell’s masterful command of language, his dynamic and complex anthropomorphic characters, and well-paced plot are precision instruments used to sharply warn its reader of the corrupting influence of power, the danger of blind obedience, and the cyclical nature of politics. As Téa Obreht, author of the foreword for the 75th anniversary edition of “Animal Farm”, says, “The book is a warning in the clearest possible way, through animal fable, that [authoritarianism] can happen everywhere.”

1122,MSNBC,fC7rROz-ByQ,Trump dumps the Federalist Society — and even Republicans are shooketh,"In a major about-face, Donald Trump is turning on the conservative powerhouse that built his judicial legacy, the Federalist Society. Yale Law professor Akhil Reed Amar warns that this break with the very group that helped propel him to power marks a dangerous shift. “He just wants loyalty to himself—thugs and hacks,” Amar says, adding that Federalist Society judges are principled and loyal to the Constitution, not to Trump. “The Senate needs to play a really important role now—especially now that he’s showing his cards.” Trump’s latest nominee, his own defense lawyer Emil Bove, has drawn sharp criticism, including from conservative circles. “It’s one thing to put people in your branch, in your cabinet—but we’re talking about life-appointed judges and justices,” Amar warns.

Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., sharply criticized Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought during a House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government hearing.
In her opening statement, DeLauro accused him of “unlawfully impounding or stealing congressionally appropriated funds.”
“You envision a king unbound by laws, who rules by decree, who accepts lavish gifts from foreign governments, who fills public offices with ultra-wealthy and political allies, and who expels opposition and crushes dissent,” DeLauro said. “This view of presidential authority could not be more un-American and more dangerous to our constitutional order.”

1420,MSNBC,DNZsYh-z1pc,Brain Drain: How Trump’s policies could wreck American innovation for generations,"70 years ago, at the height of the Red Scare, the United States deported Qian Xuesen, a pioneering Chinese-born aerospace engineer. The government accused Qian of being a communist, which he denied. Back in China, Qian continued his work, becoming known as the father of Chinese rocketry and laying the foundations for the nation’s missile and space programs. Former US Under Secretary of the Navy Dan Kimball called Qian’s deportation “the stupidest thing this country ever did.” Now, the Trump administration is seeking to block international students from studying at Harvard, threatening to revoke the visas of Chinese international students, and cutting funding for a wide range of scientific research. This is nothing more than a self-inflicted brain drain, and its consequences, driving the world’s best and brightest away from the United States, could weaken the country for generations to come.
