4,NPR,gcoZQAeIgtg,Trump's tariffs raising the price of wedding dresses in the U.S.,"Wedding gown makers and sellers are urging the federal government to exempt formalwear from President Trump's sweeping new global tariffs — China is by far the biggest hub for bridal gowns — and not just dresses, but also trims and crystals, veils and hair pieces.

Many brands have already started raising prices to offset tariff costs. Some stores are still absorbing them; others have begun charging brides.

The bridal retailers association says tariffs will not bring gown-making jobs to the U-S given the highly limited pool of skilled craftsmen for hand-beading, embroidery or lacework.

8,NPR,2j1cptiMULw,Immigration detentions reach new record highs,"The number of people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been rapidly growing.

More than 55,000 people are now held in ICE custody, according to data from the administration, numbers that now surpassed the administration's previous high of those detained, which was reached during Trump's first term in 2019.

Historical data collected by The Marshall Project suggest that the number — met just this month — is the highest ever recorded. What’s more, it is nearly 15,000 more people than what ICE is currently funded for.

Immigration experts say a big driver of the growth in how many people are detained comes from a shift in priorities: The Trump administration is arresting more people who haven’t committed any crimes beyond their civil immigration violation. Nearly three out of four people currently in ICE custody have no criminal record — and that includes minor offenses like traffic violations.

25,NPR,zUUZkUZeOrU,Pentagon says Iranian nuclear capabilities 'devastated' after U.S. strikes,"""The order we received from our commander in chief was focused, it was powerful, and it was clear,"" Hegseth said Sunday morning at a press conference at the Pentagon. ""We devastated the Iranian nuclear program. But it's worth noting the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people.""

The U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites involved seven B-2 Stealth Bombers and also included at least one submarine, according to Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon press conference.
Caine said the mission, dubbed ""Operation Midnight Hammer,"" represented the largest B-2 strike in U.S. history, involving more than 125 aircraft — including decoy flights — and saw 75 precision guided weapons dropped on the sites. ""Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Caine said.

Very few people knew details of the mission, Caine said, which began midnight Friday with B-2 bombers leaving from Kansas City, Mo.. Some of the bombers flew west into the Pacific as a decoy, while the main set of bombers flew 18 hours into Iran to carry out the attack.""Once over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex, tightly timed maneuver requiring exact synchronization across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace, all done with minimal communications,"" Caine said.

Around 5 p.m. Eastern time Saturday, a submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk missiles at a nuclear site in Isfahan as the bombers entered Iranian airspace. From approximately 6:40 p.m. to 7:05 p.m. Eastern time, the B-2s dropped 14 bunker-buster bombs on multiple targets at the Fordo and Natanz nuclear sites.The planes did not come under fire before, during or after the attack, Caine said.

The National High School Musical Theatre Awards, better known as the Jimmy Awards, bring some of Broadway’s rising stars to New York City each year to put on a show unlike any other– in just 10 days. The competition starts with about 150,000 kids from schools across the nation. After regional competitions, a select few make it to New York City to perform in the awards show at the Minskoff Theatre. The top two awards of the night – best actor and best actress in a musical – are named after Broadway legend Jimmy Nederlander.

27,NPR,pgIXfYhJnIA,Trump administration cuts specialized suicide-prevention service for LGBTQ+ youth,"The Trump administration is ending funding for specialized suicide-prevention services for LGBTQ+ youth. The option on the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline is being eliminated on July 17.

When someone contacts 988, they can press 3 if they identify as LGBTQ+ youth. That connects the person to specialized counseling services tailored for such youth, who’re at a higher risk of suicide than their peers.

Mark Henson is with The Trevor Project, one of several organizations contracted to provide those services: ""In less than a month, the program that has bipartisan backing and has had 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people use ... It would no longer be available for those who need it most.""

He says, more recently, nearly 60,000 individuals have used the service every month.

28,NPR,QOvtJMUK-dE,Trump says U.S. 'totally obliterated' nuclear facilities in Iran,"The U.S. military has joined with Israel to launch military strikes against Iran, a dramatic escalation in the years-long effort by both nations to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

""We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan,"" President Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday.

Late Saturday evening, President Trump addressed the nation from the White House, joined by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He confirmed the U.S. had launched “massive precision strikes” against three nuclear facilities within Iran. He originally announced the strikes in a post on Truth Social earlier Saturday evening.

“Our objective was the destruction of Iran’s nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to the nuclear threat,” Trump said. “Tonight I can report to the world that the strikes were spectacular military success. Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.”

U.S. involvement comes amid an escalating conflict after Israel launched its own airstrikes against Iran a little over a week ago. The U.S. had moved additional military equipment and ships into the region in recent days. On Thursday, the president said he would decide “within two weeks” whether to strike Iran and clarified further on Friday that two weeks was the “maximum” he needed to make that call. Trump has also had multiple meetings with military and national security officials in the Situation Room as he weighed what move – if any – the U.S. should take.

Goliath’s hatchling was born in early June after incubating for about four months. It is the first Galápagos tortoise hatchling born at Zoo Miami. Goliath had been matched with several female tortoises to breed, but the process had been unsuccessful until he mated with Sweet Pea, the hatchling's mother.

The zoo has submitted applications to the Guinness World Records to consider Goliath for the title of ""Oldest First-Time Father in History.”

30,NPR,axPDnJkb4-U,Free American-Israeli hostage returns home,"A dual U.S.-Israeli citizen — the last surviving American hostage in Gaza — has returned to the United States.

Edan Alexander had been held by Hamas militants until his release in May. Crowds lined the streets in Tenafly, N.J., waving Israeli and U.S. flags and cheering as an SUV brought the 21-year-old back home.

Alexander was captured while on duty serving as an Israeli soldier during the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October of 2023. He was released last month, in a standalone deal negotiated between President Trump’s administration and Hamas, who said it had been holding secret talks with the U.S. in the days leading up to his release.

Hamas said Alexander’s release was meant as part of “steps taken to establish a ceasefire” with Israel, but a ceasefire has still not come. Deadly Israeli bombardment of Gaza continues daily while 53 hostages remain in captivity there, more than half of whom are believed to be dead.

NPR spent time with a starving single mother in Gaza City to document the family's struggles for survival.

Israel is severely restricting food supplies into Gaza and trying to control its distribution, saying it's to prevent Hamas from benefiting. International aid groups say it amounts to collective punishment. Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 400 people have been killed by Israeli fire trying to reach food aid since late March.

President Trump says he has not made a decision whether to take part in attacking Iran. NPR’s Daniel Estrin spoke with Herzog in Jerusalem.

Herzog told NPR that any decision about U.S. military strikes on Iran should be made by President Trump and his team. He also said Israel decided to attack days ago after sharing intelligence with the U.S. about Iran’s nuclear plans. The U.S. National Intelligence Director testified in March that U.S. intelligence officials did not think Iran was building a nuclear weapon. Trump has dismissed the assessment.

Ed the zebra was picked up in a pasture in central Tennessee. Authorities literally picked him up — Tennessee officials wrapped up the zebra in a net and a helicopter team airlifted him to a waiting animal trailer.

Ed escaped from his owner last month — he arrived in the Christiana community in central Tennessee, on May 30, and his owner reported him missing the next day. He gained fame by running in and out of Interstate 24 traffic. No injuries were reported.

74,NPR,CdnIKw3IUwI,Jacinda Ardern thinks politics needs more kindess | NPR,"In 2017, Jacinda Ardern, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, was sitting in her bathroom, anxiously anticipating the news of two potentially life-changing events.

One, the election results that could make her the youngest female head of government in the world. And the other, a pregnancy test that could not only make her a first-time mother, but determine how she might spend the first few months of her tenure as the leader of New Zealand.

As you may know now, Arden both won the election and gave birth later that year. Her term as prime minister included her wading through motherhood in the public eye and guiding the island nation through a devastating mass shooting. After several years in office as the 40th prime minister of New Zealand, Ardern stepped down, saying she ""no longer had enough in the tank"" to continue fulfilling the role.

Ardern reflects on these moments and more in her new memoir, A Different Kind of Power. She joined All Things Considered Host Mary Louise Kelly to discuss that pivotal time and the lessons she took from her time in politics.
