2025-06-27 18:31:16,npr,"The number of people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been rapidly growing. More than 55,000 people are now held in ICE custody, according to data from the administration, numbers that now surpassed the administration's previous high of those detained, which was reached during Trump's first term in 2019. Historical data collected by The Marshall Project suggest that the number — met just this month — is the highest ever recorded. What’s more, it is nearly 15,000 more people than what ICE is currently funded for. Immigration experts say a big driver of the growth in how many people are detained comes from a shift in priorities: The Trump administration is arresting more people who haven’t committed any crimes beyond their civil immigration violation. Nearly three out of four people currently in ICE custody have no criminal record — and that includes minor offenses like traffic violations.",81738,5540,242,1441,US,7520698332751121677,Immigration,Immigration
