2025-06-03 19:07:44,washingtonpost,"Ukraine’s drone strike took 18 months to plan. For 18 months, Ukraine’s internal security service planned an audacious assault on far-flung Russian airfields — first sneaking drones into Russia, then planting them near key military runways. On Sunday, just ahead of a new round of peace talks, it was go time: Near four unsuspecting Russian military bases, remotely activated roofs lifted off mobile homes and sheds parked on flatbed trucks. Armed Ukrainian drones tucked inside soared upward, then pounced on military aircraft lined up on the runways, engulfing many in flames. The brazen attack — which Ukrainian officials claimed destroyed at least 13 Russian aircraft and damaged dozens of others — shocked Russia and instantly reduced its capabilities to threaten a nuclear attack or launch missile strikes on Ukraine and other countries. It also served as a crucial reminder to Moscow and Ukraine’s Western partners that Kyiv remains capable of exploiting Russia’s weaknesses and disrupting its war plans, despite being outnumbered and outgunned.

2025-06-03 16:19:32,washingtonpost,"The ACLU of Hawaii, which filed the suit in state court, says it has identified at least 127 people arrested from 2022 through 2024 whose breath or blood tests showed a blood alcohol level of 0.00. Nearly 9 in 10 were never charged with any crime — not even a traffic violation. “The bottom line is this totally undermines the public’s trust in law enforcement — not to mention that false arrests are unconstitutional,” said Wookie Kim, legal director at ACLU of Hawaii. In a statement, the Honolulu Police Department told The Washington Post that it is taking the allegations “very seriously” and has launched a comprehensive review of all impaired-driving arrests dating back to 2021.  The case-by-case audits will aim to identify “negative patterns” and improve training, the department said, and will be conducted “with the utmost care and integrity.” Story from an article by: María Luisa Paúl",54646,5169,69,68,US,7511758387823119647,Legal News,Crime
2025-06-03 00:06:48,washingtonpost,"A divided Supreme Court cleared the way — for now — for the Trump administration to revoke the provisional legal status of potentially hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who have been allowed to live and work in the United States while their immigration cases play out. Officials said the decision on immigration parole could affect about 530,000 migrants, though many of them may have obtained another legal status in the United States. Cubans, for instance, are eligible to apply for permanent residency and a path to citizenship under a 1966 federal law. This decision is the second this month in which the high court has given Trump officials permission to terminate programs that protect immigrants fleeing countries racked by war or economic turmoil while litigation on those programs continues. The justices also allowed the administration to revoke temporary protections that allowed a different group of nearly 350,000 Venezuelans to remain in the United States.

2025-06-04 18:43:52,washingtonpost,"Elon Musk called Trump’s new bill “a disgusting abomination” that would burden the country with “crushingly unsustainable debt.” Though Musk — who on Friday left his post as head of the U.S. DOGE Service, Trump’s cost-cutting effort — had previously criticized the bill in gentler terms, his posts on X, the social media platform he owns, represented his sharpest attack yet on the Trump White House. For months, Musk had played the role of the president’s “first buddy,” joining Trump frequently in the Oval Office and exhorting the administration to cut government spending. The posts appeared to complicate the path to passage for the legislation, which barely passed the House late last month after conservatives revolted over its enormous price tag. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the bill would increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The Senate began consideration of the measure this week, and GOP leaders hope to have it to Trump’s desk by July 4. Trump has encouraged lawmakers to pass the measure, but some Republican Senate budget hawks applauded Musk’s attack Tuesday, a potential sign of trouble. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk posted on X. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” Caption from article by Jacob Bogage and Theodoric Meyer.",362075,35561,696,298,US,7512166683872660766,Politics,Politics
2025-06-05 21:08:34,washingtonpost,"Trump reinstated his 2017 travel ban and added some more countries. The presidential proclamation, slated to go into effect June 9, fully restricts the entry of individuals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially restricts the entry of travelers from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The Trump administration, in a document circulated Wednesday evening, cited national security concerns and said the president made his decision after reviewing a State Department report. Authorities said the ban was necessary to compel foreign governments to cooperate with their agenda and enforce the country’s immigration laws. Countries included in the ban were deemed to have insufficient security vetting procedures for issuing passports or other travel documents and had high rates of citizens who overstayed their visas in the United States, authorities said. The new travel restrictions include exceptions for lawful permanent residents, existing visa holders, certain visa categories, and individuals whose entry serves U.S. national interests. Democrats condemned the administration’s announcement and cast the ban as a betrayal of American values. Sen. Edward J. Markey (Massachusetts) said the move will not make America safer, and Sen. Adam Schiff (California) said the ban will serve to further isolate the United States on the global stage. Rep. Yassamin Ansari (Arizona), who is Iranian American, said the “xenophobic and racist ban will devastate my constituents and families like mine.” Caption from article by David Nakamura, Emily Davies and Marianne LeVine.",139671,13882,130,108,US,7512575140228500766,Politics,Politics

In the order doubling the tariffs, President Donald Trump wrote that the higher levies “will provide greater support to these industries and reduce or eliminate the national security threat posed by imports of steel and aluminum articles and their derivative articles.” But for American companies that rely on specialized metals that aren’t available domestically, the order set off a fresh scramble to raise prices and rethink hiring and investment.

2025-06-09 21:01:18,washingtonpost,"Who gets the 23andMe Data?? The fate of genetic data belonging to millions of 23andMe customers is again up in the air, as the bankrupt company seeks a judge’s permission to consider another bid from its co-founder and undisclosed financial backers after previously accepting an offer from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. A nonprofit research institute backed by Anne Wojcicki, 23andMe’s co-founder and former CEO, has been pressing 23andMe to consider additional bids purportedly topping Regeneron’s $256 million cash offer last month, arguing that the bankruptcy auction was closed prematurely.  That has put 23andMe in a bind, with the firm saying in court filings it was at risk of litigation unless it effectively reopened the auction to entertain final offers from Wojcicki’s group and Regeneron. So 23andMe is proposing a compromise that would allow TTAM Research Institute, founded by Wojcicki, to make a final bid and give Regeneron the opportunity to make a counteroffer. Should TTAM prevail, 23andMe would pay Regeneron a $10 million breakup fee. Caption from a story by: By Daniel Gilbert and Elizabeth Dwoskin",16107,945,13,15,US,7514057560966597918,Health,Health
2025-06-09 17:47:09,washingtonpost,"President Donald Trump’s order to deploy 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles appears unprecedented, relying on an unorthodox use of a law aimed at quelling serious domestic unrest or an attack on the United States by a foreign power, some legal experts said Sunday. It marks the first time in about 60 years that an American president has taken such action without a governor’s consent. Furthermore, his executive order authorizes the Pentagon to dispatch military personnel domestically to enable federal functions and protect government property — a chilling sign, the experts said, that Trump is prepared to send troops into other cities in response to protests. “That is completely unprecedented under any legal authority,” said Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “The use of the military to quell civil unrest is supposed to be an absolute last resort.” Caption from article by Justin Jouvenal and Alex Horton.",530950,37691,387,245,US,7514007524190752031,Politics,Politics

Security officials said they plan to close numerous D.C. streets, some for up to four days, and deploy thousands of police officers and federal agents for the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday celebration as the city braces for throngs of onlookers expected to attend a huge military parade and festival along the National Mall. The large-scale military parade is the result of a confluence of interests: a president who has long pushed for the kind of grand pageant he’d witnessed in other countries, and a military that was now willing to show off its might. For a president who loves crowds, who relishes big displays of heavy equipment and whose inauguration was pushed indoors because of cold weather, everything has fallen in place for an event set to take place on June 14 — Trump’s 79th birthday. The Pentagon is now under the control of loyalists, and the guardrails previously in place are gone.
