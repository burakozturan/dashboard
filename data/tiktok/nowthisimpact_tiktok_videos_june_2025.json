According to the Trevor Project, more than 1.8 million LGBTQ+ young people in the U.S. seriously consider suicide each year, with at least one attempt every 45 seconds. Cutting funding for 988 would put even more LGBTQ+ youth at risk. Jaymes Black, CEO of the Trevor Project, thanked those who signed the letter, saying: \u2018I am deeply grateful to the influential voices in entertainment who are speaking out and reminding the public that suicide prevention is about people \u2014 not politics.\u2019",

Establishing DACA in 2012 allowed over 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children to live and work legally \u2014 without the constant threat of deportation. But DACA was never meant to be a permanent fix \u2014 it doesn\u2019t grant lawful status or a pathway to citizenship, and must be renewed every two years. Without Republican cooperation, many DACA recipients are stuck in legal limbo, unable to secure permanent residency or citizenship and vulnerable to changing policies or even having the program terminated.",

His own mother called him \u2018an abuser of women.\u2019 His aggressive behavior puts the many allegations against him into perspective. He\u2019s been accused of violent sexual assault, which he paid $50,000 to settle out of court. His former sister-in-law also alleged that he was abusive toward his second wife, according to a sworn affidavit to the Senate. She claimed his ex-wife had to develop an \u2018escape plan\u2019 involving a safe word which was used at least once. Hegseth has also been accused of making extreme statements about women and religious minorities while drunk. His interaction with a reporter calling her \u2018about the worst\u2019 for simply asking questions gives us a glimpse into who he really is.",
