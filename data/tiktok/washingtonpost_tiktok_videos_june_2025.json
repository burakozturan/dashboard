For 18 months, Ukraine\u2019s internal security service planned an audacious assault on far-flung Russian airfields \u2014 first sneaking drones into Russia, then planting them near key military runways. On Sunday, just ahead of a new round of peace talks, it was go time: Near four unsuspecting Russian military bases, remotely activated roofs lifted off mobile homes and sheds parked on flatbed trucks. Armed Ukrainian drones tucked inside soared upward, then pounced on military aircraft lined up on the runways, engulfing many in flames. The brazen attack \u2014 which Ukrainian officials claimed destroyed at least 13 Russian aircraft and damaged dozens of others \u2014 shocked Russia and instantly reduced its capabilities to threaten a nuclear attack or launch missile strikes on Ukraine and other countries. It also served as a crucial reminder to Moscow and Ukraine\u2019s Western partners that Kyiv remains capable of exploiting Russia\u2019s weaknesses and disrupting its war plans, despite being outnumbered and outgunned.

Officials said the decision on immigration parole could affect about 530,000 migrants, though many of them may have obtained another legal status in the United States. Cubans, for instance, are eligible to apply for permanent residency and a path to citizenship under a 1966 federal law. This decision\u00a0is the second this month in which the high court has given Trump officials permission to terminate programs that protect immigrants fleeing countries racked by war or economic turmoil while litigation on those programs continues. The justices also allowed the administration to\u00a0revoke temporary protections\u00a0that allowed a different group of nearly 350,000 Venezuelans to remain in the United States.

For months, Musk had played the role of the president\u2019s \u201cfirst buddy,\u201d joining Trump frequently in the Oval Office and exhorting the administration to cut government spending. The posts appeared to complicate the path to passage for the legislation, which barely passed the House late last month after conservatives revolted over its enormous price tag. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the bill would increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The Senate began consideration of the measure this week, and GOP leaders hope to have it to Trump\u2019s desk by July 4. Trump has encouraged lawmakers to pass the measure, but some Republican Senate budget hawks applauded Musk\u2019s attack Tuesday, a potential sign of trouble. \u201cThis massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk posted on X. \u201cShame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.

        "video_description": "Trump reinstated his 2017 travel ban and added some more countries. The presidential proclamation, slated to go into effect June 9, fully restricts the entry of individuals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially restricts the entry of travelers from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The Trump administration, in a document circulated Wednesday evening, cited national security concerns and said the president made his decision after reviewing a State Department report. Authorities said the ban was necessary to compel foreign governments to cooperate with their agenda and enforce the country\u2019s immigration laws. Countries included in the ban were deemed to have insufficient security vetting procedures for issuing passports or other travel documents and had high rates of citizens who overstayed their visas in the United States, authorities said. The new travel restrictions include exceptions for lawful permanent residents, existing visa holders, certain visa categories, and individuals whose entry serves U.S. national interests. Democrats condemned the administration\u2019s announcement and cast the ban as a betrayal of American values. Sen. Edward J. Markey (Massachusetts) said the move will\u00a0not make America safer, and Sen. Adam Schiff (California) said the ban will serve to\u00a0further isolate the United States\u00a0on the global stage.\u00a0Rep.

The fate of genetic data belonging to millions of 23andMe customers is again up in the air, as the bankrupt company seeks a judge\u2019s permission to consider another bid from its co-founder and undisclosed financial backers after previously accepting an offer from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. A nonprofit research institute backed by Anne Wojcicki, 23andMe\u2019s co-founder and former CEO, has been pressing 23andMe to consider additional bids purportedly topping Regeneron\u2019s $256 million cash offer last month, arguing that the bankruptcy auction was closed prematurely.  That has put 23andMe in a bind, with the firm saying in court filings it was at risk of litigation unless it effectively reopened the auction to entertain final offers from Wojcicki\u2019s group and Regeneron. So 23andMe is proposing a compromise that would allow TTAM Research Institute, founded by Wojcicki, to make a final bid and give Regeneron the opportunity to make a counteroffer. Should TTAM prevail, 23andMe would pay Regeneron a $10 million breakup fee. Caption from a story by: By Daniel Gilbert and Elizabeth Dwoskin",

        "video_description": "UPDATE: U.S. x China trade war China has returned to trade talks with the United States this week holding, from its perspective, a strong hand: Its economy is bearing up better than many people \u2014 including President Donald Trump \u2014 expected. It has watched as Trump\u2019s unconventional trade policy has suffered some legal setbacks. And it has a geopolitical ace card: It is controlling the export of much-needed rare earths. This shows how the Trump administration underestimated Beijing\u2019s ability to withstand the pain of tariffs, according to analysts both inside and outside China. The tariffs reached a minimum of 145 percent before a temporary truce was declared in Geneva last month. \u201cBack in February, the mainstream narrative in the U.S. was, \u2018Oh, the Chinese economy is bad, so if the U.S. is going to use tariff stick, China would have no choice but to surrender,\u2019\u201d said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.

        "video_description": "Everyone say hi to video intern @Mariana Trujillo \ud83d\udc4b A divided Supreme Court ruled against Planned Parenthood, saying Medicaid patients do not have a right to sue to obtain non-abortion health care from the organization\u2019s medical providers. The\u00a06-3 ruling, with all three liberal justices dissenting, reversed a lower-court decision that had allowed a Planned Parenthood South Atlantic patient to seek to reinstate the group\u2019s clinics as qualified health care providers after South Carolina cut off all Medicaid funding for the organization because it offers abortion services. The decision means patients who rely on Medicaid will not be able to\u00a0use the government insurance program for the poor to get services at the Planned Parenthood clinics in South Carolina.
