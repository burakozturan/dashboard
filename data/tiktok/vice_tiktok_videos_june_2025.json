In this remote region, they practice an ancient tradition of honey hunting where they descend towering cliffs on handmade ladders, to harvest honey nestled under jagged overhangs. In spring, the Gurung\u2019s honey contains a rare substance called grayanotoxin from rhododendron flowers that\u2019s known for its intoxicating effects. While some accounts say it\u2019s a deadly poison, others refer to it as an aphrodisiac, powerful medicine, and a hallucinogenic drug. Back in 2016, VICE travelled deep into the Annapurna mountains to join a Gurung village on their spring hunt and understand Mad Honey's effects. Tap the link in bio to watch.",
